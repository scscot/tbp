        <h2>What Stella & Dot Sells (in plain English)</h2>
        <p>Stella & Dot is a boutique-style fashion jewelry and accessories company founded in 2003 by Jessica Herrin, celebrating over 20 years of empowering women through flexible entrepreneurship. The product line features contemporary jewelry including layering necklaces, statement earrings, stackable rings, and delicate bracelets with modern vintage aesthetics. Core collections include versatile handbags, fashion scarves, and accessories designed for everyday style and special occasions. Products are crafted with quality materials—gold and silver plating, semi-precious stones, and durable hardware—at accessible price points ($28-$198 range). The brand emphasizes trunk show party experiences where Independent Stylists host intimate shopping events, combining boutique retail atmosphere with social selling. Seasonal collections refresh quarterly with trend-forward designs.</p>
        <p class="muted">Stella & Dot appeals to women 25-55 seeking affordable luxury jewelry with boutique styling, eliminating the need to visit high-end retail stores while enjoying personalized shopping experiences at home.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Who Buys Stella & Dot</h3>
          <p>Stella & Dot attracts fashion-conscious women seeking boutique-quality jewelry without department store prices, busy professionals wanting convenient shopping experiences, gift buyers looking for thoughtful presents, and jewelry enthusiasts who appreciate modern vintage designs. The customer base spans women 25-65 with emphasis on 30-50 year old style-aware consumers. The business opportunity appeals to fashion influencers, former retail workers seeking flexibility, stay-at-home moms wanting part-time income, event planners who understand hosting, and entrepreneurial women seeking low-barrier entry business with established brand recognition and proven trunk show model.</p>
          <p class="muted">Strong appeal to women who value work-life balance and flexible scheduling—host trunk shows around family commitments and personal lifestyle.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>How Stella & Dot Distributes</h3>
          <p>Stella & Dot operates a direct sales compensation plan offering 25-35% commission on personal sales, with higher commission tiers for volume achievers. Independent Stylists earn through trunk show sales, online boutique orders, and team building bonuses. New stylists receive 50% off products during their first 30 days to build inventory and personal collection. The company emphasizes social selling, trunk show parties (in-home or virtual), and digital boutique storefronts. Rank progression includes Stylist, Senior Stylist, Director, Senior Director, and Executive Director levels with increasing team bonuses and leadership incentives. No monthly minimums or inventory requirements—stylists can operate completely on-demand ordering.</p>
          <p class="muted">Key insight: Trunk show model creates urgency—limited-time shopping experiences with exclusive host rewards drive higher average orders than passive online browsing.</p>

        <h2>Training & Onboarding Snapshot</h2>
        <p>Stella & Dot emphasizes trunk show hosting, styling expertise, and social selling techniques in training. New Independent Stylists learn product knowledge, hosting best practices, and styling consultation skills through online training modules, virtual workshops, and upline mentorship. The company provides trunk show kits, digital marketing assets, and customer engagement tools. However, traditional training focuses on in-person party planning and personal network activation—leaving systematic social media prospecting, automated follow-up sequences, and scalable customer acquisition largely unaddressed. Most stylists struggle translating fashion passion into consistent bookings and duplicatable team systems beyond their immediate warm market.</p>

        <h2>Your AI Recruiting Playbook for Stella & Dot</h2>
        <ol class="checklist" id="getting-started-list">
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Seasonal gift-giving campaigns.</strong> Target Mother's Day (May), holiday season (November-December), Valentine's Day (February), and graduation season (May-June) with jewelry gift guides. Use AI to automate annual campaigns showcasing popular gift items at each price point—automated sequences that deploy every year without manual recreation.</li>
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Fashion influencer partnership outreach.</strong> Identify micro-influencers (5k-50k followers) in fashion, lifestyle, and mom blogger niches. Use AI to systematically reach out with trunk show hosting opportunities and stylist partnerships. Many influencers seek flexible income streams—position Stella & Dot as branded partnership opportunity.</li>
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Bridal party targeting.</strong> Brides seek bridesmaid gifts, getting-ready jewelry, and bridal party coordinated accessories. Create "Bridal Collection" content targeting engaged women in wedding planning groups. Use AI to engage these highly-motivated buyers during 6-12 month wedding planning windows with trunk show hosting opportunities.</li>
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Virtual trunk show automation.</strong> Most stylists still focus on in-person parties. Build systematic virtual trunk show sequences—Facebook Live shopping events, Instagram styling sessions, and Zoom trunk shows. Use AI to schedule, promote, and follow up on virtual events, expanding reach beyond geographic limitations.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Corporate gifting business targeting.</strong> Companies purchase employee appreciation gifts, client thank-you presents, and recognition awards. Create B2B outreach targeting HR departments, event planners, and small business owners. Use AI to systematically pitch bulk ordering and custom corporate gift programs.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Styling quiz lead magnet.</strong> Create "What's Your Jewelry Style?" interactive quiz driving email capture. Use AI to segment quiz takers by style preference (boho, classic, minimalist, statement) and deliver personalized product recommendations. This builds qualified prospect lists for trunk show invitations.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Host rewards urgency messaging.</strong> Stella & Dot offers generous host rewards (free jewelry, half-price items). Use AI to create urgency-based outreach: "Host a trunk show this month and earn $100+ in free jewelry." Automate monthly host recruitment campaigns targeting previous customers and warm market contacts.</li>

        <h2>Getting Started with Stella & Dot: Your First 30 Days</h2>
        <p class="muted">New to Stella & Dot? Here's your step-by-step roadmap to launching your Independent Stylist journey with boutique jewelry and flexible entrepreneurship:</p>
        <ol class="checklist" id="getting-started-list">
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Day 1-3: Foundation Setup</strong> — Complete your Stella & Dot stylist enrollment, order your starter kit ($199 value with product samples, trunk show supplies, and training materials), and set up your personal digital boutique storefront. Study the compensation plan structure—understand 25-35% commission tiers, 50% off first 30 days benefit, and team building bonus qualifications. Explore current seasonal collections and bestsellers.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 1: Build Your Personal Collection</strong> — Use your 50% off first 30 days discount to purchase 8-12 pieces you'll personally wear. Focus on versatile bestsellers: layering necklaces, statement earrings, everyday bracelets, and stackable rings. Wear these daily. Your personal styling becomes your strongest recruiting tool—people will ask "Where did you get that necklace?" every day.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 1: Product Knowledge Deep Dive</strong> — Study Stella & Dot collections by category: layering jewelry, statement pieces, bridal accessories, gift-worthy items under $50, and signature collections. Learn styling tips—how to layer necklaces, stack rings, and mix metals. Master the trunk show format: 60-90 minute shopping party with styling consultation, try-on experiences, and host rewards explanation.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 2: First Trunk Shows Scheduled</strong> — Book your first 3 trunk shows within 30 days. Start with warm market hosts: friends, family members, coworkers who love jewelry. Explain host rewards (free jewelry for $500+ party sales, half-price items, exclusive host-only pieces). Create Facebook event pages, send digital invitations, and post sneak peeks of collection pieces. Aim for 8-15 guests per party.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 2: Team Build Pro Setup</strong> — Download Team Build Pro to organize your prospect pipeline by interest category (jewelry customers, potential hosts, stylist prospects), track who's engaging with your trunk show invitations, and let qualified prospects start building their own teams before officially joining, so they launch with pre-built momentum.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 3: Execute First Trunk Shows</strong> — Host your first 2-3 trunk shows (in-person or virtual). Set up attractive product displays, create try-on stations, demonstrate styling techniques (layering, mixing metals, statement vs. everyday pieces). Share your personal styling story—why you love wearing Stella & Dot daily. Collect orders, explain auto-ship VIP program (free shipping, exclusive access), and ask for referrals. Follow up within 48 hours with thank-you messages and delivery timelines.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 3-4: Customer Reorders & Host Recruitment</strong> — Follow up with trunk show attendees 2 weeks after delivery: "How are you loving your new pieces? Want to see the new spring collection?" Convert 30% of customers to repeat buyers. Identify top 3-5 enthusiastic customers—people who posted photos wearing their jewelry, referred friends, or asked detailed styling questions. Invite them to host their own trunk show with generous host rewards pitch.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 4: First Stylist Recruits</strong> — Identify 1-2 serious business builders—hosts whose parties generated $500+ sales, customers who love jewelry and have strong social networks, or fashion-oriented individuals seeking flexible income. Walk them through stylist enrollment. Help them claim their 50% off first 30 days benefit and schedule their first 2 trunk shows for Week 5. Share your trunk show hosting system and product knowledge resources.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>First 30 Days: Jewelry Styling Content Strategy</strong> — Post daily "styling tip" content on social media: "3 Ways to Layer This Necklace," "Statement Earrings for Work vs. Weekend," "Jewelry Stacking Tutorial." Wear Stella & Dot pieces in every photo and video. Use AI to schedule posts, respond to engagement, and convert comments into trunk show bookings. Build your online presence as the "jewelry styling expert" in your network.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Ongoing: Boutique Style Business System</strong> — Use Team Build Pro to track your trunk show booking calendar, identify customers ready for reorder outreach, maintain consistent communication across your team, and duplicate your hosting system. Focus on monthly metrics: 4-6 trunk shows per month, $400+ average party sales, 2-3 new hosts recruited monthly, and 1 new stylist enrolled every 60 days. Your jewelry styling passion combined with systematic prospecting creates sustainable business growth.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> New Stella & Dot stylists who host 3+ trunk shows in their first 30 days, build a 10-15 piece personal jewelry collection, and recruit their first stylist within 60 days create teams that are 5x more sustainable. Team Build Pro helps you track trunk show bookings, organize customer follow-up by purchase date, and duplicate your boutique styling system as your team grows.</p>

        <p><strong>Compliance note:</strong> <a href="https://stelladot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stella & Dot</a> policies require accurate income disclosures, no guaranteed earnings claims, and proper representation of the business opportunity. Focus on product quality, trunk show experiences, and flexible entrepreneurship benefits. When discussing business opportunity, always include income disclosure statement and clarify that results vary based on individual effort, hosting consistency, and market conditions. Emphasize that stylist success requires active trunk show hosting, customer relationship building, and team support.</p>
        <p>When in doubt, let the system do the heavy lifting—consistent trunk show booking, seasonal campaigns, and targeted host recruitment work better than exaggerated income claims or pressure tactics.</p>
