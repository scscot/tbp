        <h2>What Scentsy Sells (in plain English)</h2>
        <p>Scentsy is an American direct sales company founded in 2003 and headquartered in Meridian, Idaho, specializing in wickless candle warmers and scented wax products. The flagship offering is decorative electric warmers that melt specially formulated Scentsy Bars using low-watt bulbs or heating elements—delivering fragrance without flame, smoke, or soot. Product categories include ceramic and glass warmers in hundreds of designs, Scentsy Bars with rotating seasonal fragrances, plug-in Mini Warmers, car fresheners (Scentsy Go), diffusers and essential oils, body care products (Scentsy Body line), laundry care (Scentsy Washer Whiffs scent boosters), and cleaning products. All wax products are manufactured in-house at the Idaho headquarters facility.</p>
        <p class="muted">Scentsy's seasonal catalog model creates urgency and collectibility, with new warmer designs and fragrances retiring quarterly—driving repeat purchases and consultant engagement.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Who Buys Scentsy</h3>
          <p>Scentsy attracts home decor enthusiasts, candle lovers seeking safer alternatives, busy parents avoiding open flames around children, apartment dwellers with candle restrictions, and gift-givers looking for personalized warmer designs. The customer base skews female, aged 25-55, with disposable income for home ambiance products. The business opportunity appeals to stay-at-home moms, military spouses needing portable income, college students, and anyone seeking low-barrier entrepreneurship with minimal technical knowledge required. Social selling through Facebook parties dominates consultant activity.</p>
          <p class="muted">Strong U.S. and Canadian presence with growing international markets in Europe and Australia.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>How Scentsy Distributes</h3>
          <p>Scentsy operates a multi-level marketing compensation plan where consultants earn 20-36% commission on personal retail sales based on monthly volume. Leadership positions unlock bonuses through team building, with ranks from Certified Consultant to Star Director and beyond. There's no minimum monthly purchase requirement, no inventory mandates, and a low starter kit cost. Consultants purchase products at wholesale prices and sell at retail, keeping the margin. The model emphasizes parties, online sales through personal websites, and social media engagement. Key differentiator: no complex quotas and straightforward commission structure make onboarding simple for non-sales-experienced recruits.</p>
          <p class="muted">Key insight: Product collectibility and seasonal urgency drive reorders—use catalog transitions as recruiting and reactivation opportunities.</p>

        <h2>Training & Onboarding Snapshot</h2>
        <p>Scentsy emphasizes party-based selling and social media engagement in training. New consultants learn the "Share, Book, Recruit" model through online training portals, team Facebook groups, and upline mentorship. Corporate provides party scripts, booking incentives, and seasonal promotions. However, traditional training focuses on Facebook Live events and in-home parties—leaving automated prospecting, digital follow-up systems, and multi-channel nurture campaigns largely unexplored. Most consultants rely on personal networks that exhaust quickly without systematic lead generation and re-engagement strategies.</p>

        <h2>Your AI Recruiting Playbook for Scentsy</h2>
        <ol class="checklist">
          <li><strong>Safety-angle prospecting.</strong> Target parents, teachers, and apartment dwellers with flame-free messaging. Create video content showing warmers around kids and pets. Use AI to identify and message followers who engage with parenting, home safety, or rental living content.</li>
          <li><strong>Seasonal catalog countdown automation.</strong> Build 14-day pre-launch sequences before each quarterly catalog release. Tease retiring fragrances and new designs. Create urgency with "last chance" messaging for current favorites. Automate reminders across email, SMS, and social channels.</li>
          <li><strong>Warmer personality quiz.</strong> Create an interactive quiz matching customers to warmer styles (farmhouse, modern, whimsical, elegant). Use AI to segment results and send personalized product recommendations plus booking invitations based on style preferences.</li>
          <li><strong>Subscription customer conversion.</strong> Identify customers who order monthly or quarterly. Build an AI sequence offering consultant discount advantages after their 3rd purchase. "You're spending enough to save 20-36% as a consultant" messaging converts repeat buyers into business builders.</li>
          <li><strong>Gift season automation.</strong> Create holiday, teacher appreciation, Mother's Day, and housewarming gift campaigns with product bundles. Use AI to remind past customers of upcoming gifting occasions based on previous purchase patterns. "You bought teacher gifts last May—want this year's ideas?" outperforms generic blasts.</li>
          <li><strong>Party host reward ladder.</strong> Build automated sequences for party hosts showing how 3 parties could fund their warmer collection for free, while 6 parties could generate enough in free products to transition into consultantship. Visualize the path from customer to host to consultant with specific dollar breakdowns.</li>
          <li><strong>Fragrance preference tracking.</strong> Use AI to tag customers by scent families (bakery, floral, fresh, fruity). When new fragrances launch, automatically notify relevant segments. "You loved Cinnamon Vanilla—our new Maple Butter Pancakes just dropped" creates higher conversion than mass messaging.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Compliance note:</strong> Scentsy policies prohibit income claims without disclaimers and require accurate product representations. Focus on flame-free safety, fragrance variety, and home decor aesthetics. Use official product pages and approved marketing materials. When discussing business opportunity, always clarify that results vary based on individual effort and that most consultants earn modest supplemental income. Never guarantee specific earnings or recruit with exaggerated lifestyle claims.</p>
        <p>When in doubt, let the system do the heavy lifting—consistent catalog promotions, customer conversion tracking, and automated party host sequences work better than hype or pressure tactics.</p>
