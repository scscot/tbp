I’m considering creating explainer videos for the Team Build Pro websites. I tasked Joe with looking into this and giving me his recommendations. Your task is to consider the prompts I gave Joe and his responses, then do your own research and give me your thoughts and recommendations while also considering Joe’s feedback and recommendations.

Prompt 1 For Joe:

Review the current Team Build Pro ecosystem and conduct deep research to determine the expected return (by way of App downloads on App Store and Google Play) if I get the $99/month API Pro Plan. I’m just trying to get an idea if the result of adding these types of video content will result in higher website traffic, higher conversion rates, and more app downloads. One more thing, I have an automated Blog Creation script that produces two new blogs per week, and for each new blog created, I will add automation to create a 60 second summary script of the new blog, then use Hey Gen API to create the video summarizing the blog and I will also provide a link with the video where the user can click to read the entire blog.

Joe’s Response:

Short answer: video should help, but it’s not a magic slot machine. The $99/mo only pays off if you (a) actually push those videos where people see them and (b) already have or can build meaningful traffic. Right now, given what I know about your ecosystem, I’d treat HeyGen as a measured experiment, not as guaranteed ROI.
I’ll walk through this in numbers, not hype.

1. Where video fits in your current ecosystem
From the knowledge base:
* You already have 4 full sites (EN/ES/PT/DE) with content parity and app CTAs on every post/page.
* The blog system is automated with a script that currently produces two posts per week (GitHub workflow weekly-blog.yml).
* Each blog post already includes a “Get the App” section driving people to App Store / Google Play.
* Email campaigns and Firestore-based contacts are already in place, so you have channels where video thumbnails/links can be dropped in.
Your proposed change:
* 2 new blog posts per week (≈ 8–9 per month).
* For each post, auto-generate:
    * 60-second summary script
    * HeyGen avatar video
    * Link in / under the video that sends people to the full blog post
* On top of that, you’ve also talked about 8 one-minute “core” explainers duplicated into 3 languages for the main sites.
So, you’re essentially building a compounding library of short explainer videos that can live:
* On the blog itself (top of post)
* On social (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Reels, Shorts)
* On YouTube / channel playlists
* Inside emails as a thumbnail that clicks to the site
The impact depends on three things:
1. How many people actually see the videos (distribution)
2. How many who see them click through
3. What percentage of those end up installing the app
Let’s pull in what the data says before we start guessing.

2. What the research says video actually does
a) On landing pages & blogs
Multiple studies (largely focused on landing pages, but the mechanics carry over to blog posts):
* Adding video to a landing page has been shown to increase conversions by up to ~80–86% in some experiments, especially for sign-up / subscription goals.(Firework)
* Around 30% of top landing pages already include video, suggesting serious marketers consider it “standard equipment”, not a gimmick.(Website)
Those “up to” numbers are best case, not guaranteed. A realistic uplift for a well-done explainer on a good page is more like 15–40% relative improvement, not “2× overnight”.
b) On app downloads specifically
* One industry write-up notes that 64% of consumers are more likely to download an app after watching a good explainer video.(Vidico)
* A concrete case study (Well-being Plus) reports an explainer video campaign that boosted app downloads by about 25% and got 100K+ views.(Digizinc)
* Other app explainer agencies explicitly pitch explainer videos as a way to drive installs by clearly showing UI/UX and value.(Blue Carrot)
The pattern: when the video is actually seen and the CTA is clear, you can reasonably expect double-digit percentage gains in installs from the traffic that already exists.
c) In email
You already run Mailgun campaigns. For email:
* Including a video (or strong video link) in email can increase click-through rates by ~65–96% vs text-only emails.(Campaign Monitor)
So putting your HeyGen clips in email is one of the few places where the uplift can be pretty dramatic if subject lines and lists are decent.
d) General traffic & attention
* Video is projected to account for around 82% of all consumer internet traffic by 2025.(Personify)
* Short explainer/educational videos are among the highest-converting formats across lead-gen campaigns.(Wistia)
The high-level takeaway: video won’t automatically send you traffic, but when your pages get traffic, well-executed video tends to:
* Keep people on the page longer
* Increase the rate at which they take the main action (clicking your CTA)

3. A simple model: what could this mean in installs?
Since you didn’t give live GA numbers here and I don’t want to fake precision, I’ll walk you through a scenario modelyou can plug real numbers into.
Let’s start with an easy baseline:
Assume 1,
000 blog/landing page visits per month (across all languages) that see a clear “Get the App” CTA.
If your actual monthly traffic is 300, divide everything by ~3; if it’s 3,
000, multiply by 3.
Step 1 — Baseline (no video)
Let’s use conservative but reasonable numbers from landing-page benchmarks:
* Visitor → App Store page click rate (from blog/landing): 3%
    * This is below the 6.6% “average landing page conversion” reported by Unbounce, to stay conservative for an app CTA.(Unbounce)
* App Store / Play Store page → install rate: 20%
    * This is in line with common install conversion ranges for non-brand apps where the listing is decent.
For 1,
000 visitors/month:
* 1,
000 × 3% click through to the stores = 30 clicks
* 30 × 20% install = 6 installs per month
Step 2 — With HeyGen videos everywhere
Now assume you:
* Put a tight 60-second explainer at the top of each new blog post
* Use those clips in email and social posts that point people into the blogs
* Add 8 “core” videos across the main pages (home, professionals, prospects, a couple top company pages, etc.)
Based on the research above, a realistic range for decent implementation is:
* Traffic uplift to those pages over time (via SEO + social sharing of videos):
    * Low: 0%
    * Mid: +20%
    * High: +40%
* Blog/landing → App Store click rate uplift (better explanation, higher trust):
    * Low: +15% relative
    * Mid: +30% relative
    * High: +60% relative
* Store page → install uplift (warmer visitors who already “get it”):
    * Low: +10% relative
    * Mid: +20% relative
    * High: +40% relative
Let’s run the math on 1,
000 baseline visitors:
Low case (good but not amazing implementation)
* Traffic: still 1,
000 visits (no change)
* Blog → Store click rate: 3% × 1.15 = 3.45%
* Store → Install: 20% × 1.10 = 22%
Results:
* 1,
000 × 3.45% = 34.5 store clicks
* 34.5 × 22% ≈ 7.6 installs
* Incremental vs baseline: ~2 extra installs/month
Mid case (solid videos, reused in email + social)
* Traffic: 1,
000 × 1.2 = 1,
200 visits
* Blog → Store click rate: 3% × 1.30 = 3.9%
* Store → Install: 20% × 1.20 = 24%
Results:
* 1,
200 × 3.9% = 46.8 store clicks
* 46.8 × 24% ≈ 11.2 installs
* Incremental vs baseline: ~5 extra installs/month
High case (you actually nail it)
* Traffic: 1,
000 × 1.4 = 1,
400 visits
* Blog → Store click rate: 3% × 1.60 = 4.8%
* Store → Install: 20% × 1.40 = 28%
Results:
* 1,
400 × 4.8% = 67.2 store clicks
* 67.2 × 28% ≈ 18.8 installs
* Incremental vs baseline: ~13 extra installs/month
Step 3 — Scale that to more realistic traffic
If, once you fix GA and let the content machine run, your combined EN/ES/PT/DE ecosystem gets around 3,
000 relevant visits/month to app-oriented pages and blog posts:
Multiply the incremental installs by 3:
* Low case: ~6 extra installs/month
* Mid case: ~15 extra installs/month
* High case: ~39 extra installs/month

4. Is $99/month “worth it” under those scenarios?
Let’s look at cost per incremental install (CPI) just from the HeyGen spend, ignoring your other sunk costs.
At $99/month:
* 6 extra installs → $16.50 per extra install
* 15 extra installs → $6.60 per extra install
* 39 extra installs → $2.54 per extra install
Now compare that to a reasonable revenue band:
For a $4.99/mo subscription:
* If only 10% of installers end up paying and stay for 6 months, revenue per download is:0.10 × 6 × $4.99 ≈ $3.00
* If 20% of installers pay and stay for 12 months, revenue per download is:0.20 × 12 × $4.99 ≈ $12.00
So:
* If you’re closer to the $3 per download reality, paying $16.50 per extra install is a losing bet.
* If you’re closer to the $12 per download reality, paying $2–7 per extra install is perfectly fine.
And here’s the part you need to confront directly:
If your current organic traffic is truly in the low hundreds per month, the low-case scenario is the most realistic until you fix distribution.
At 300 visits/month, the mid case above turns into something like:
* Incremental installs ≈ 1–2/month
* Effective CPI: $50–$100 per extra install
That’s just not defensible on ROI grounds. In that world, the HeyGen spend is basically a brand/credibility expense.

5. How the blog + video automation specifically changes things
Your automation plan is smart structurally:
* 2 posts/week × 4 languages → the library grows fast over 6–12 months.
* Every blog gets its own 60-second video, which:
    * Gives Google a richer page (text + embedded media)
    * Gives you ready-made assets for Reels/Shorts/TikTok
    * Gives you a thumbnail to drop into Mailgun campaigns
The compounding effect is real:
* Hostinger’s analysis: sites with 10–15 landing pages see ~55% more customers than those with fewer pages.(Hostinger)
* You’re on track to accumulate dozens of app-relevant pages per language, each with a video. If you actually distribute those videos, your traffic assumptions can go from “1,
000/month” to much higher over time.
But again: that compounding only happens if you actively push the videos to places where people already are (YouTube, socials, email) and point them back to your own pages (not straight to the stores).

6. My straight answer on the $99 HeyGen API plan
Putting everything together:
When the $99/mo does NOT make hard financial sense (for now)
* If your effective app-oriented traffic is currently under ~1,
000 visits/month across all four sites, then the expected incremental downloads from video alone are low single digits per month.
* In that context, $99 is best framed as:
    * a brand polish expense
    * a content-system investment you make before traffic justifies it
* If you’re cash-constrained and want measurable installs, I would not treat the HeyGen plan as a primary growth lever yet. I’d push harder on:
    * Fixing GA and Search Console issues
    * Basic paid tests (even $5/day) to drive targeted traffic
    * Continuing email list growth and cleaning
When the $99/mo starts to look justified
I’d say the plan becomes reasonable once you hit at least one of these:
1. 3,
000+ relevant visits/month to your TBP sites (combined)
2. You’re already seeing 10–20+ installs/month coming from web (not app-store search), and you want to push that up by 25–50%
3. You intend to use the same HeyGen assets everywhere:
    * Website hero & blog posts
    * Social content calendar
    * YouTube channel playlists (EN/ES/PT/DE)
    * Email campaigns as the main hook
Under that setup, the mid-case scenario (15 extra installs/month at 3k visits) gives you a $6–7 CPI, which is entirely acceptable for a subscription app if your conversion/retention aren’t awful.
How I’d run this in practice (no fluff, just a plan)
If you do pull the trigger, don’t just “add video” and hope:
1. Define the test window
    * 90 days, with a clear “go/no-go/adjust” decision at the end.
2. Instrument properly
    * Separate GA4 events for:
        * video_play (on blog/landing)
        * cta_click_app_store (to App Store / Play)
    * UTM-tag links from videos (YouTube/Shorts/Reels) back to your blog, not straight to the stores.
3. Create an A/B structure
    * For the first 8–12 new blogs:
        * Half get the full video treatment immediately.
        * Half stay text-only for 60–90 days.
    * Compare:
        * Time on page
        * Click-through to app stores
        * Install counts from those pages (use UTM and referrer data where possible)
4. Push distribution hard
    * Minimum per blog:
        * 1 YouTube Short
        * 1 TikTok/Reel
        * 1 Facebook/Instagram post
        * Inclusion in at least one Mailgun send
If after 90 days you still don’t see at least a 20–30% uplift in either store clicks or installs from web-sourced traffic, you pause the $99 and revisit once your baseline traffic is higher.

My blunt take
* If your traffic today is truly tiny, HeyGen will not “save” you. It will make your ecosystem look more polished and future-ready, but it won’t magically pump downloads.
* As a medium-term bet (6–12 months), layered on top of growing traffic, the numbers become reasonable. The compounding blog+video system is aligned with the infrastructure you’ve already built.
* Treat the $99/mo as an experiment with strict measurement, not as a fixed, unquestioned line item.
You’re not crazy for wanting this – the direction is right. But you should be ruthless about data: if the numbers don’t move, you cut it and redirect the money to the channel that does move installs.


Prompt 2 For Joe:

What do you think about creating a 90 second explainer video that will be translated and embedded in the homepages (EN, ES, DE, PT) that gives an overview of of the Team Build Pro features and benefits. Just doing this to start.

Joe’s Response:

Stephen, here’s the straight answer as Joe—no fluff, no buzzwords, no wishful thinking.
A single 90-second explainer video, translated and embedded across all four homepages, is the smartest possible starting point if you want to test whether video moves the needle before you commit to heavy automation or a $99/mo ongoing API bill.
Let me break this down into what matters most: impact, placement, cost efficiency, and risk.

✅ 1. Will a 90-second explainer help?
Yes. It’s one of the few video assets that consistently works across industries because it does three things at once:
1. Sets the frame for what the product is
People hit a homepage cold and often don’t read enough to understand the value. A clean explainer cuts through that friction immediately.
2. Boosts conversion by reducing cognitive load
Visitors only give you a few seconds. If the video clearly shows the workflow, outcomes, and why the app is useful, you’re giving their brain an easier path.
3. Increases trust
TBP is new. People are skeptical of new software. A polished, consistent, multi-language explainer helps position TBP as established.
This is especially important for the prospect audience, which already has higher skepticism.

✅ 2. Why starting with ONE signature video is the right move
a) It’s the lowest-risk test
You’re not committing to dozens of videos. You’re creating one flagship asset and watching how it changes:
* Time on homepage
* Scroll depth
* CTA clicks to the App Store / Play Store
* Install rate
If it doesn’t move numbers, you stop.If it does, you expand.
b) Four language versions make it feel “built for everyone”
Your entire ecosystem is multilingual. If someone hits ES, DE, or PT and sees English video content, you lose momentum.Automated translations + lip-sync give you a frictionless localization upgrade.
c) You can reuse this one asset everywhere
* Homepages
* Product pages
* YouTube
* TikTok/Instagram Reels (cut into short clips)
* Mailgun campaigns
* Ads (if you ever test them)
* App Store / Google Play promo videos
One properly built explainer gets you six months of mileage.

✅ 3. Expected return (realistic, not inflated)
Based on research-backed numbers (and the earlier models I gave you):
A well-done homepage explainer typically improves:
• On-page engagement by ~20–40%
People stay longer and scroll more.
• CTA clicks by ~15–30%
Because they finally “get it.”
• App installs from homepage visitors by ~10–25%
Cold visitors become warm prospects.
Your current multilingual ecosystem already has the structure; the video fills the missing “anchor.”
You’re not going to triple installs from one video.But if you get even 10–20 additional installs per month once traffic grows, the video pays for itself quickly.

✅ 4. Cost vs Value
Cost:One 90-sec video translated into 4 languages = cheap relative to ongoing monthly API plans. Especially since it’s a one-off.
Return:A homepage explainer will outperform a blog explainer every day of the week because:
* The homepage sits at the top of the funnel.
* Every visitor sees it.
* It’s the strongest “first impression” asset you can make.
Starting with this is logical and financially responsible.

✅ 5. What I would challenge you to do next
Don’t just make the video—set this up as an actual data experiment.
Before adding the video:
* Record 14 days of:
    * Homepage visits
    * CTA clicks
    * App Store / Play Store outbound clicks
    * Installs (web-sourced)
After adding the video (all four homepages):
* Record the same 14 days.
If you get:
* +15% in CTA clicks
* +10–25% in installs
…then you know the video experiment is working, and you move forward with scaling video into blogs, emails, and social content.
If the lift is near zero, you stop right there and avoid wasting the $99/mo API plan.

⭐ My verdict
Stephen, this is the right move.Not dozens of videos.Not automation.Not a $99/mo commitment.
One multilingual 90-second flagship explainer.
You’ll learn more in 30 days from that single asset than from any speculation.

Prompt 3 for Joe:

OK. Please recommend a plan for using Hey Gen API to create the Team Build Pro explainer video (90 seconds) using their Avatars. Thoroughly review the entire Team Build Pro ecosystem and recommend 3 different versions of a 90-second explainer video script. I will then share your plan with Claude to get his feedback as well.

Joe’s Response:

Short answer, Stephen: starting with one 90-second explainer, localized into EN/ES/PT/DE using HeyGen avatars, is exactly the right move. I’ll give you:
1. A concrete HeyGen API plan for that explainer
2. A structure for the 90-second spot
3. Three complete script variants you can test (same length, different angle)
You can hand this straight to Claude as a spec.

A. Plan for using HeyGen API for the TBP explainer
1) Lock the creative spec
Goal:One 90-second “flagship” explainer that:
* Sits near the top of the homepage for EN/ES/PT/DE
* Speaks to direct-sales / network-marketing leaders and serious prospects
* Shows that Team Build Pro is company-agnostic and works with their referral link, not as an “opportunity” itself(Chrome Stats)
Technical spec:
* Length: 90s
* Aspect ratio: 16: 9 (for web + YouTube); later you can clip into 9: 16 for Shorts/Reels
* Resolution: 1280×720 (fits within HeyGen limits and is fine for web)(HeyGen API Documentation)
* Format: MP4
* One primary avatar; same avatar across all languages for consistency

2) Choose avatar + voices via API
Use HeyGen’s API to pick assets:
* List Avatars (V2) to browse avatar choices and grab an avatar_id that matches your brand (calm, professional, not hypey).(HeyGen API Documentation)
* List Voices (V2) and List Locales for Voices to select:(HeyGen API Documentation)
    * Neutral American English
    * Latin American Spanish
    * Brazilian Portuguese
    * Standard German
You or Claude can filter by:
* Gender / tone
* Locale (en-US, es-419, pt-BR, de-DE)
* “Natural” or “conversational” styles rather than announcer voices

3) Decide script workflow: manual vs template
For this flagship, I’d avoid over-engineering and keep it simple:
1. Write the English master script (I’ve given you 3 versions below).
2. Translate into ES/PT/DE manually or with review (not raw machine translation). Tone matters here.
3. For each language, call Create Avatar Video (V2) with:(HeyGen API Documentation)
    * avatar_id
    * voice_id
    * script (localized text)
    * dimension: { width: 1280, height: 720
}
If you want to reuse the same layout later at scale, you can later build a Template in HeyGen Studio and call the Template API for blog videos, but for this first explainer you don’t need that complexity.(HeyGen API Documentation)

4) Poll status & store the finished files
* Each POST /v2/video/generate returns a video_id.(HeyGen API Documentation)
* Poll Retrieve Video Status/Details until status is completed and you get a download URL.(HeyGen API Documentation)
* Download the MP4 and host it on your own infrastructure (Firebase Hosting, Cloud Storage, or DreamHost) because HeyGen URLs expire after ~7 days.(HeyGen API Documentation)

5) Embed on the homepages + tracking
For each of EN/ES/PT/DE:
* Place the video directly under the hero section (“AI Recruiting System for Direct Sales Professionals…”)(Team Build Pro)
* Above or beside the video, keep a single, focused CTA:
    * Buttons: “Download on the App Store” / “Get it on Google Play”
* Instrument GA4:
    * home_video_play (event when user clicks play)
    * home_video_25, home_video_50, home_video_90 (watch depth)
    * home_appstore_click and home_googleplay_click (separate events)
* Compare 14–30 days before vs after adding the video per locale:
    * CTR to app stores
    * App installs attributed to web traffic (using UTM + referrer data)

B. Script architecture for a 90-second explainer
Aim for ~220–240 words per script (about 150 words per minute × 1.5 minutes).
Recommended structure:
1. 0–15s – Hook
    * Speak to their pain: random recruiting, prospects ghosting, team with no system.
2. 15–35s – What Team Build Pro is
    * Clear, simple: “An AI recruiting and team-building app for direct sales professionals that uses your company, your referral link, and your message.”(Team Build Pro)
3. 35–65s – How it works (3–4 concrete features)
    * Pre-building system (prospects build teams before joining)(Chrome Stats)
    * AI Coach with 24/7 message help and roadmaps(Team Build Pro)
    * Real-time team tracking and notifications(Team Build Pro)
    * Works with any direct-sales or network-marketing company; TBP doesn’t promote an opportunity.(Chrome Stats)
4. 65–80s – Outcome / use case
    * Sponsor + prospect story: 30-day pre-build, smoother launch, less dropout.(Team Build Pro)
5. 80–90s – Close / CTA
    * “Download Team Build Pro on the App Store or Google Play, start your 30-day free trial, and let your prospects experience the system before Day 1.”(Team Build Pro)
Now the three script variants.

C. Three 90-second explainer scripts
All three can use the same visual storyboard; only the wording shifts. Think of these as:
1. Version A – Sponsor-focused (leaders first)
2. Version B – Dual-audience (leaders + serious prospects)
3. Version C – Story-driven (one sponsor, one prospect)
You can test which one “feels” most right to you and your early adopters, then localize that one.

Version A – Sponsor-focused “System First” script
Angle: Talk directly to experienced direct-sales / network-marketing leaders who are tired of chasing recruits and watching new people stall out.
[Hook – 0–15s
]If you lead a direct-sales or network-marketing team, you already know the pattern. You sign someone up, they’re excited for a week, then recruiting slows, group chats go quiet, and the whole team is back to starting from scratch.
[What TBP is – 15–35s
]Team Build Pro is an AI recruiting and team-building app built for this exact problem. It works with yourcompany, your message, and your referral link. You plug in your details, and Team Build Pro becomes a simple, repeatable system your whole organization can run.
[How it works – 35–65s
]New prospects don’t just hear a pitch and disappear. Inside the app, they work through a guided 30-day experience where they start building their own contact list, invite partners, and see what their first team could look like before they ever join.
At the same time, your AI Coach is on call 24/7 with pre-written recruiting messages, follow-up prompts, and milestone roadmaps, so nobody has to guess what to send or do next.
You see your organization in real time—who’s active, who’s building, and who needs help—without living inside a spreadsheet.
[Outcome + CTA – 65–90s
]The result is simple: your prospects step into your business with real momentum, and your existing leaders are finally working from the same system instead of “doing their own thing.”
Download Team Build Pro on the App Store or Google Play, start your 30-day free trial, and give every new recruit a real team-building experience before Day 1.

Version B – Dual-audience “You + Your Prospects” script
Angle: Speak to both the leader and the serious prospect in one flow. Emphasize that TBP is neutral software, not an opportunity.
[Hook – 0–15s
]Whether you’re building a direct-sales team or thinking about joining one, the biggest fear is the same: “Will this actually work for me, or will I be on my own after I sign up?”
[What TBP is – 15–35s
]Team Build Pro is an AI-powered app that answers that question up front. It’s not an income opportunity or a company. It’s a recruiting and team-building system that works with the business you already represent—or the one you’re considering.
Your sponsor adds their company name and referral link, and Team Build Pro becomes a private team-building space for that organization.
[How it works – 35–65s
]As a prospect, you can spend 30 days inside the app, guided by the AI Coach. You’ll build your contact list, send invites with proven scripts, and start to see who might join your future team—before you make a final decision.
As a leader, you finally have a simple way to give every prospect and every new recruit the same messages, the same roadmap, and the same daily actions, without writing everything from scratch.
Real-time tracking shows who’s taking action, who’s bringing in partners, and where people are getting stuck, so you can support them early instead of after they’ve quit.
[Outcome + CTA – 65–90s
]Instead of hype, everyone sees the system in action. You know what it feels like to build with structure, you know what your first 30 days will look like, and you know you aren’t doing it alone.
Download Team Build Pro on the App Store or Google Play, start your free 30-day trial, and see what your next team could look like before Day 1.

Version C – Story-driven “30 Days Before Day 1” script
Angle: Tell a simple sponsor + prospect story that shows what “pre-building” actually looks like.
[Hook – 0–20s
]Meet Dana. She’s been in direct sales for a while, but every launch feels the same. She signs people up, group chats explode for a week, and within a month, most of those new recruits are gone.
Then she tries something different. Before inviting her next prospect to join, she gives him a 30-day experience inside an app called Team Build Pro.
[What TBP is – 20–40s
]Team Build Pro is an AI recruiting and team-building app for direct-sales and network-marketing professionals. Dana adds her company name and referral link, and the app becomes her team-building system—without changing the business she’s part of.
[How it works – 40–75s
]Her prospect, Marcus, downloads the app and meets the AI Coach.
Instead of just “thinking about it,” Marcus starts building:– He lists his first contacts– He sends invites using proven scripts in his own voice– He sees a simple roadmap of what his first 30 days would look like
Dana doesn’t have to manually walk him through every step. She can see his progress, answer questions, and know exactly when he’s ready to join.
By the time Marcus says yes, he’s not a cold recruit. He already has potential partners, real conversations, and a clear plan inside the app.
[Outcome + CTA – 75–90s
]That’s the difference Team Build Pro brings to your organization: prospects step in with momentum, and leaders spend their time coaching builders, not restarting from zero.
Download Team Build Pro on the App Store or Google Play, start your 30-day free trial, and let your next Marcus experience your system before Day 1.

If you want, we can also create a fourth, shorter 45–60 second cut based on whichever of these three you like best, specifically for Reels/Shorts/TikTok with more visual beats and less narration.

Prompt 4 for Joe;

Let me give you a bit more clarity. I'll start with two videos; one for direct sales professionals (https: //teambuildpro.com/?ref=88888888), and one for recruiting prospects (https://teambuildpro.com/?new=88888888). Review each of the URL to understand the nuanced messaging differences, then create two versions of each scenario, and return a complete plan again.

Joe’s Response:

Stephen — good, now we’re getting tight and specific.I reviewed both URLs as instructed to understand the messaging difference between:
1. Direct Sales Professionals (Sponsors / Leaders)
https: //teambuildpro.com/?ref=88888888
2. Recruiting Prospects (New People Considering Joining)
https: //teambuildpro.com/?new=88888888
The differences in those pages matter a lot for video scripting, because they speak to completely different emotional states and decision thresholds.
Below is your revised full plan — two explainer videos, each with two script versions (total of four scripts), and a complete practical implementation plan using the HeyGen API.
I’m treating this as something you can hand directly to Claude with no guesswork.

✅ QUICK SUMMARY OF THE MESSAGING DIFFERENCES
A. Direct Sales Professionals (Sponsor / Leader)
Key emotional drivers on the page:
* They’re frustrated with inconsistent recruiting.
* They’re tired of “hit or miss” duplication.
* They want leverage: a system that works for their entire downline.
* They want to pre-qualify recruits so they waste less time.
* They respond to systemization, tracking, duplication, predictability.
Your page messaging focuses on:
* AI Coach
* Team-building system
* Prospect pre-build
* Faster launches
* Real-time activity tracking
This audience needs confidence that:
“TBP will make my team easier to run and my recruits stronger.”

B. Recruiting Prospects (People Considering Joining)
Key emotional drivers on the page:
* They are skeptical but curious.
* They want to know whether this business model will work for THEM personally.
* They don’t want hype.
* They want clarity, guidance, and a preview of success.
* They want to see what their first 30 days look like.
Your page messaging focuses on:
* Experience the business before Day 1
* Build a contact list
* See your potential team
* AI Coach guiding you step-by-step
* Make an informed decision instead of guessing
This audience needs reassurance:
“You’ll understand exactly what to do, and you won’t be left alone.”

✅ THE PLAN: TWO VIDEOS, FOUR SCRIPT OPTIONS
Each video will be 90 seconds.Each video gets two versions (A and B), so you can test tone and pacing.

🔷 VIDEO #1 — For Direct Sales Professionals (Sponsors / Leaders)
Version A — “System + Leverage” Approach
Focus: duplication, reliability, team growth without chaos.
[
    0–15s
]If you build teams in direct sales, you already know the hardest part isn’t finding people — it’s giving every new recruit the same clear path so they don’t stall out in their first month.
[
    15–35s
]Team Build Pro fixes the chaos. It’s an AI-driven recruiting and team-building system that works with yourcompany, your referral link, and your message. Your entire organization follows the same simple structure from Day 1.
[
    35–65s
]Prospects don’t join blind. Inside TBP, they pre-build for 30 days: building their contact list, sending invites using natural scripts, and seeing who’s ready to join before they ever say yes.
Your AI Coach keeps everyone moving — from messages to follow-ups to daily actions — without you having to chase people.
You see exactly who’s active, who’s growing, and where support is needed.
[
    65–90s
]Result? New recruits hit launch week prepared. Leaders coach instead of babysitting. Teams grow with consistency instead of burnout.
Download Team Build Pro and give every recruit a proven system — not a guessing game.

Version B — “Pain + Relief” Approach
Focus: burnout, time waste, inconsistent downlines.
[
    0–15s
]Most leaders in direct sales have the same problem: your business depends on duplication, but everyone on your team is doing something different.
[
    15–35s
]Team Build Pro gives you consistency. It’s an AI-powered system designed to standardize how your team recruits, follows up, and launches — without rewriting scripts or micromanaging.
[
    35–65s
]When a prospect enters your referral link, they get a full 30-day experience: messages to send, partners to invite, steps to complete, and progress you can see in real time.
Your recruits finally know exactly what to do, and you finally know where to support them.
No more long calls explaining the basics. No more losing people because they “weren’t sure what to say.”
[
    65–90s
]Stronger launches. More duplication. Less burnout.
Team Build Pro becomes the structure behind your success.
Download TBP today and lead your business with clarity instead of chaos.

🔷 VIDEO #2 — For Recruiting Prospects (New / Curious Individuals)
Version A — “Try Before You Join” Approach
Focus: letting them experience the business safely.
[
    0–15s
]Thinking about joining a direct sales business? The biggest question is the same for everyone: “Will this actually work for me?”
[
    15–35s
]Team Build Pro gives you the chance to find out first. It’s a private AI-guided experience your sponsor shares with you so you can see what your first 30 days would look like.
[
    35–65s
]Inside the app, you build your contact list, send natural messages with AI help, and see who might join your future team — before you make any commitments.
You get daily steps, reminders, and coaching so you always know what to do next.
No hype. No pressure. Just clarity.
[
    65–90s
]Instead of guessing whether this business fits you, you’ll have real conversations, real momentum, and a real picture of what your team could become.
Download Team Build Pro and take your 30-day preview — and make your decision with confidence.

Version B — “Your First 30 Days” Storytelling Approach
Focus: simple narrative; low-pressure; relatable.
[
    0–20s
]When people consider joining direct sales, they usually have two concerns: “What do I actually do each day?” and “Will I get support?”
[
    20–40s
]Team Build Pro answers both. Your sponsor shares their referral link, and you get a guided 30-day experience showing exactly how the business works.
[
    40–70s
]The AI Coach helps you:– Build a contact list– Start real conversations– Invite people naturally– Track who’s responding
You won’t be thrown into a group chat and told to “figure it out.”
You’ll see your own early traction before you join.
[
    70–90s
]Instead of taking a leap of faith, you get a clear, structured preview of success.
Download Team Build Pro, start your 30-day experience today, and decide based on results — not hope.

✅ EXECUTION PLAN: USING HEYGEN FOR THE TWO VIDEOS
Step 1 — Select avatar and voice for both videos
Keep the same avatar for all languages to maintain brand continuity.
Use HeyGen:
* GET /v2/avatars (pick neutral, professional avatar)
* GET /v2/voices with locales:
    * en-US
    * es-419
    * pt-BR
    * de-DE

Step 2 — Produce 8 total videos
You will create:
* Direct Sales Professional Video — Version A (4 languages)
* Direct Sales Professional Video — Version B (4 languages)
* Prospect Video — Version A (4 languages)
* Prospect Video — Version B (4 languages)
But to start, produce:
* Direct Sales Video — Version A in EN
* Prospect Video — Version A in EN
Then only translate & produce the winning versions.

Step 3 — API Call Structure
Example payload you can hand to Claude:
POST https: //api.heygen.com/v2/video/generate
{
    "avatar_id": "YOUR_AVATAR_ID",
    "voice_id": "YOUR_VOICE_ID",
    "script": "YOUR_FINAL_SCRIPT_TEXT_HERE",
    "dimension": {
        "width": 1280,
        "height": 720
    },
    "background": "white",
    "config": {
        "subtitle": false
    }
}
The API returns:
* video_id
* Poll /v2/video/status?video_id=... until "status": "completed"
* Download URL
* Save to Firebase / DreamHost (HeyGen URLs expire)

Step 4 — Placement on the Websites
Direct Sales Video
Place on:
* https: //teambuildpro.com/?ref=xxxxxx
* /professionals/ pages
* EN/ES/PT/DE homepages in the “For Direct Sales Professionals” row
Place above the fold, directly under the hero.
Prospect Video
Place on:
* https: //teambuildpro.com/?new=xxxxxx
* Prospect onboarding pages
* Shareable landing pages
Place immediately under the section:
“Experience your first 30 days BEFORE you join.”

Step 5 — Tracking & Metrics
Track per language + per audience:
Events:
* video_play_professional
* video_play_prospect
* app_click_professional_ios
* app_click_professional_android
* app_click_prospect_ios
* app_click_prospect_android
Metrics to compare:
* Click-through rates to the app stores
* Time on page
* Scroll depth
* Web-originated installs
* Trial activations
* Sponsor link attribution
This will quickly reveal which video perform better.

If you want next steps:
I can also:
* Rewrite all 4 scripts into ES, PT, and DE
* Create matching subtitle versions
* Create cut-down 30-sec versions for Shorts/Reels
* Design your full HeyGen template so you can mass-produce blog-summary videos later



Stephen — I’ll produce all **4 scripts × 4 languages** (EN, ES, PT-BR, DE) AND separate **subtitle-ready versions** for each.

To keep this clean and usable for HeyGen + Claude, I’ll structure the output like this:

---

# ✅ STRUCTURE OF THIS DELIVERY

For **each of the four explainer videos**, you will receive:

1. **Full Script – Spanish (ES)**
2. **Full Script – Portuguese Brazil (PT-BR)**
3. **Full Script – German (DE)**
4. **Subtitle Version (ES / PT-BR / DE)**

   * Line-broken
   * No punctuation that causes subtitle desync
   * No sentences longer than ~7–9 seconds
   * Ready for HeyGen “subtitle” or SRT creation

---

# ⚠️ BEFORE I GENERATE EVERYTHING

These translations must be accurate **to your meaning**, especially because:

* We are speaking to **two distinct audiences**,
* Europeans + LATAM have very different expectations about “direct sales,”
* Certain words must be *avoided* because they imply illegal income claims or hype in regulated markets.

**If you approve the following choices, I will produce the entire set immediately:**

---

# 🔎 **LANGUAGE STRATEGY (Needs Your Confirmation)**

## **1. Spanish → LATAM-Neutral (not Castilian Spanish)**

Because TBP is aimed at Spanish-speaking Americas first, not Spain.

I will use:

* “ventas directas”
* “negocio de venta directa / marketing en red”
* “patrocinador”
* “primeros 30 días”
* “lista de contactos”

NOT:

* “multinivel” (too aggressive; regulated heavily)
* “oportunidad” (avoid hype triggers)

---

## **2. Portuguese → Brazil (PT-BR)**

Direct sales in Brazil is huge; tone must stay grounded.

Terms I will use:

* “vendas diretas”
* “marketing de rede”
* “patrocinador”
* “primeiros 30 dias”

Avoiding hype words like:

* “oportunidade incrível”
* “ganhos”
* “renda extra”

---

## **3. German → Formal Neutral (DE-DE)**

German-speaking markets (DE/AT/CH) are *very* wary of MLM language.
Tone must be **professional, reserved, informational**.

I will use:

* “Direktvertrieb”
* “Netzwerkmarketing”
* “Sponsor”
* “erste 30 Tage”

Avoid entirely:

* “Verdienst”
* “Finanzielle Freiheit”
* “Schnell wachsen”

---

# 🔎 ONE MORE THING

Do you want **subtitles translated literally**, or should subtitles be:

### **Option A — Literal translation**

Matches narration exactly.
Best for lip-sync avatars.

### **Option B — Reader-optimized subtitles**

Shorter, easier to read, same meaning but fewer words.
Best for clarity.

Pick **A** or **B**.

---

# 👉 **Stephen: Once you confirm these TWO items, I will output all 48 deliverables in one clean, structured drop.**

### I need your confirmation on:

1. **Language approach**

   * ES: Latin American
   * PT: Brazilian
   * DE: Formal, precise, conservative
     ✔️ OK?

2. **Subtitle style**

   * Option A: Literal
   * Option B: Reader-optimized
     Which do you want?

---

### After your confirmation, here is what I will deliver:

* **Direct Sales Video – Script A (ES / PT-BR / DE + subtitles)**
* **Direct Sales Video – Script B (ES / PT-BR / DE + subtitles)**
* **Prospect Video – Script A (ES / PT-BR / DE + subtitles)**
* **Prospect Video – Script B (ES / PT-BR / DE + subtitles)**

Total: **48 formatted scripts**
Clean, ready for HeyGen API or Claude workflow.

---

“Proceed with the language plan”**
+
**Subtitle option A


Excellent, Stephen.
You confirmed:

✔️ **Proceed with the language plan** (ES-LATAM, PT-BR, DE formal)
✔️ **Subtitle Option A** (literal translation matching narration exactly)

Below is the **full multilingual package**:
**4 scripts × 3 languages × subtitle versions = 24 deliverables**

Everything is formatted for **HeyGen API**, Claude workflows, and later SRT generation.
