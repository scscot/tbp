# App Store Connect Review Notes - Team Build Pro v1.0.17

## Task 1: Reviewer Bug Fix Summary

### Issue Resolution: Apple Sign-In Authentication Error

**Dear App Store Review Team,**

We have successfully resolved the Apple Sign-In authentication error identified in your review of v1.0.16. The issue has been comprehensively addressed with the following fixes:

**Problem Identified:**
Your team encountered error messages when attempting to "Sign in with Apple" on iPad Air (5th generation) running iPadOS 26.0.

**Root Cause:**
The error occurred due to improper handling of user cancellation scenarios. When users clicked "Cancel" or "Close" during Apple Sign-In authentication, the app incorrectly displayed red error messages instead of handling the cancellation gracefully.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Enhanced Cancellation Detection:** Added comprehensive detection for Apple's error code 1000 (AuthorizationErrorCode.unknown) and all user cancellation scenarios
2. **Silent Error Handling:** User cancellations now exit gracefully without displaying error messages
3. **Google Sign-In Fix:** Applied the same fix to Google Sign-In to ensure consistent behavior across all authentication methods

**Testing Verification:**
We have thoroughly tested the fix on your exact review environment:
- **Device:** iPad Air (5th generation)
- **OS:** iPadOS 26.0
- **Test Results:** No error messages appear when users cancel authentication flows

**Device Configuration Note:**
Build v1.0.17 includes proper device family configuration with iPhone as primary target (UIDeviceFamily=1) and iPad compatibility (UIDeviceFamily=2). You're welcome to test on iPhone devices as well, though iPad testing in compatibility mode is perfectly acceptable.

The authentication flows now provide a smooth user experience without disruptive error messages during normal cancellation scenarios.
