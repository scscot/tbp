        <h2>What Coway Sells (in plain English)</h2>
        <p>Coway is South Korea's #1 environmental home appliance company, founded in 1989 and publicly traded on the Korean Stock Exchange with $2.9 billion revenue (2022). The product line features premium home wellness appliances with innovative technology—water purifiers (reverse osmosis systems, alkaline ionizers, countertop and under-sink models), air purifiers (HEPA filtration, smart air quality sensors, odor elimination), bidets (heated seats, adjustable water temperature, self-cleaning nozzles), water softeners (whole-home systems, salt-free options), mattresses (pressure relief, temperature regulation), and air conditioners. Coway operates a hybrid rental-subscription model where customers can rent appliances with monthly service, creating ongoing relationships beyond one-time purchases. The company emphasizes innovative technology, premium quality, and exceptional customer service with regular filter changes and maintenance included in rental agreements.</p>
        <p class="muted">Coway's rental-subscription model differentiates from traditional appliance sales—create residual income streams through customer subscriptions rather than one-time commissions alone.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Who Buys Coway</h3>
          <p>Coway attracts health-conscious homeowners seeking clean water and air quality solutions, families with young children concerned about environmental toxins, environmentally aware consumers prioritizing home wellness, renters and homeowners preferring subscription models over large upfront purchases, and individuals valuing premium quality with ongoing service. The customer base spans ages 30-60 with emphasis on middle to upper-middle-class households. The business opportunity appeals to sales professionals with direct selling experience, home improvement enthusiasts, health and wellness advocates, environmentally conscious entrepreneurs, and individuals attracted by commission on both sales and ongoing rental subscriptions with residual income potential.</p>
          <p class="muted">Strong appeal to subscription economy consumers—Coway's rental model, regular maintenance service, and low upfront cost resonate with customers who prefer ongoing relationships over large one-time purchases.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>How Coway Distributes</h3>
          <p>Coway operates through independent sales representatives called Codys with a $199 startup kit. Representatives earn commission on product sales and ongoing residual income from customer rental subscriptions. The compensation structure includes direct sales commissions, monthly residual income from active customer subscriptions, team building bonuses on downline sales and rentals, rank advancement rewards, and car programs for top performers. Codys can focus on retail customers (rental subscriptions) or build sales teams for leveraged income. The hybrid MLM-rental model creates dual income streams: immediate commissions plus long-term residual income from customer subscriptions and service contracts.</p>
          <p class="muted">Key insight: Rental-subscription model creates residual income opportunities—focus on customer retention and ongoing service relationships rather than one-time transactional sales.</p>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <section>
        <h2>Training & Onboarding Snapshot</h2>
        <p>Coway emphasizes product knowledge, in-home demonstration techniques, and customer service excellence. New Codys learn about water purification technology (reverse osmosis, filtration stages), air purification science (HEPA filters, air quality sensors), rental-subscription benefits, and product comparison training through online modules, in-person training sessions, and upline mentorship. The company provides demonstration equipment, sales scripts, and customer service protocols. However, traditional training focuses on in-home presentations and face-to-face selling—leaving systematic digital prospecting, automated follow-up sequences, social media content strategies, and scalable customer acquisition largely unaddressed. Most Codys struggle transitioning from warm market to consistent cold market prospecting beyond immediate networks.</p>

        <h2>Your AI Recruiting Playbook for Coway</h2>
        <ol class="checklist" id="getting-started-list">
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Water quality crisis positioning.</strong> Create content highlighting municipal water contamination concerns—lead, chlorine, pharmaceuticals, microplastics. Use AI to systematically share water safety content in parenting forums, home improvement groups, and health-conscious communities. Position Coway water purifiers as the "peace of mind solution" for families concerned about tap water quality.</li>
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Air quality and allergy relief targeting.</strong> Target households with allergy sufferers, asthma patients, pet owners, and parents of young children. Use AI to identify and engage allergy relief forums, indoor air quality discussions, and pet owner communities. Create comparison content: "Air purifiers vs. HVAC filters—which actually removes allergens and odors?" Coway's smart air quality sensors provide measurable results.</li>
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Rental-subscription benefit campaigns.</strong> Most competitors require large upfront purchases. Coway offers rental subscriptions with maintenance included. Create content: "Why rent your water purifier instead of buying—lower upfront cost, regular filter changes included, service warranties." Use AI to engage budget-conscious consumers, renters, and subscription economy enthusiasts who prefer monthly payments over $1,500+ upfront investments.</li>
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Home wellness ecosystem approach.</strong> Position Coway as a complete home wellness solution—water purification for hydration, air purification for breathing, bidets for hygiene, mattresses for sleep quality. Use AI to deploy "whole home wellness" content in home improvement forums, minimalist lifestyle communities, and wellness-focused social groups. Create bundles: "The healthy home starter pack."</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>New homeowner and renter targeting.</strong> Target recent home buyers, apartment renters, and relocating families making initial home setup decisions. Use AI to identify new homeowner forums, apartment living communities, and relocation groups. Create content: "Essential home wellness appliances for your first home—start with clean water and air." Rental model appeals to renters who can't invest in permanent fixtures.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Environmental sustainability storytelling.</strong> Coway's filter replacement and recycling programs reduce plastic bottle waste. Create content comparing bottled water costs and environmental impact vs. Coway water purifiers: "Eliminate 5,000+ plastic bottles per year per household." Use AI to share sustainability stories in zero-waste communities, eco-conscious parenting groups, and environmental advocacy forums.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Residual income business opportunity focus.</strong> Unlike one-time commission products, Coway's rental subscriptions create ongoing residual income. Create business opportunity content: "Build a wellness business with monthly recurring income—every customer rental generates ongoing commissions." Use AI to engage network marketing veterans, passive income seekers, and entrepreneurs looking for subscription-based businesses with predictable revenue.</li>

        <h2>Getting Started with Coway: Your First 30 Days</h2>
        <p class="muted">New to Coway? Here's your step-by-step roadmap to launching your Cody journey with premium home wellness appliances:</p>
        <ol class="checklist" id="getting-started-list">
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Day 1-3: Foundation Setup</strong> — Complete your Coway Cody enrollment with $199 startup kit, set up your sales representative account, and receive demonstration equipment or product samples. Study the compensation plan structure—understand commission rates on sales, residual income from rental subscriptions, team building bonuses, and rank advancement from sales representative through leadership levels. Learn the rental-subscription model advantages and customer retention strategies.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 1: Personal Home Wellness Experience</strong> — Install a Coway water purifier and air purifier in your home (rental or purchase). Test water quality before and after purification, monitor air quality sensors, and experience daily filter performance. Document taste improvements in drinking water, reduction in household odors, allergy relief observations, and overall wellness changes. Your 7-day personal experience becomes your strongest recruiting tool—"I installed Coway water and air purifiers and noticed my kids' allergies improved within a week."</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 1: Product Technology Deep Dive</strong> — Study Coway's water purification technology (reverse osmosis stages, filtration processes, mineral enhancement), air purification science (HEPA filtration levels, smart sensors, odor elimination), bidet features (hygiene benefits, water temperature control), and mattress technology. Learn product comparison talking points: Coway vs. Brita, Coway air purifiers vs. Dyson, rental vs. purchase economics. Master the technology story for educated prospects who research appliance specifications thoroughly.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 2: Warm Market Home Wellness Outreach</strong> — Create your contact list of 50-100 people. Segment by wellness interest: families with young children (clean water/air for kids), allergy sufferers (air purification relief), health-conscious individuals (whole home wellness), renters (subscription model benefits), and business opportunity seekers. Share your personal Week 1 home wellness experience. Focus on measurable improvements—water taste, air quality readings, allergy symptom reduction.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 2: Team Build Pro Setup</strong> — Download Team Build Pro to organize your prospect pipeline by wellness category (families, allergy sufferers, new homeowners, business builders), track who's engaging with your home wellness content, and let qualified prospects start building their own teams before officially joining, so they launch with pre-built momentum in Coway's rental-subscription environment.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 3: First In-Home Demonstrations</strong> — Conduct 10-15 in-home demonstrations or virtual consultations. Bring water quality testing equipment, show air quality sensor readings, explain rental-subscription benefits with specific audiences: water purification for families with children, air purifiers for allergy sufferers, complete home wellness packages for health-conscious homeowners. Use Coway's technology and rental model as differentiators. Follow up on Day 3 (initial impressions), Day 7 (decision timeline), and Day 14 (conversion conversation).</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 3-4: First Customers & Rental Subscriptions</strong> — Convert 5-10 demonstration prospects to customers (sales or rental subscriptions). Focus on entry-level products: countertop water purifiers, bedroom air purifiers, starter wellness packages. Earn immediate sales commissions plus ongoing residual income from rental subscriptions. Emphasize rental benefits—low upfront cost, included maintenance, filter replacement service. Use Team Build Pro to track customer renewal dates and service schedules.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 4: First Codys & Team Building</strong> — Identify 1-2 serious business builders—people who achieved personal results with Coway products, understand home wellness value proposition, have networks in real estate or home services, or seek residual income through subscription-based business. Walk them through Cody enrollment. Help them set up demonstration equipment and schedule their first 10 in-home presentations for Week 5. Share your home wellness demonstration system and rental-subscription selling strategies.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>First 30 Days: Home Wellness Content Strategy</strong> — Post daily "home wellness education" content on social media: water quality testing results, air purification before/after measurements, rental vs. purchase comparisons, family health testimonials. Share your personal home wellness journey with specific observations. Use AI to schedule posts, respond to product questions, and convert engagement into in-home demonstrations. Position yourself as the "home wellness consultant" in your network.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Ongoing: Rental-Subscription System</strong> — Use Team Build Pro to track your customer rental renewal cycles, identify prospects ready for demonstration sequences, maintain consistent communication with subscription customers for upsells and referrals, and duplicate your home wellness demonstration system. Focus on monthly metrics: 5-10 new customer installations per month, convert 60% of demonstrations to sales or rentals, recruit 2-3 new Codys monthly, and maintain 85%+ customer retention through excellent service. Your home wellness passion combined with systematic demonstrations and rental-subscription model creates sustainable recurring income growth.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> New Coway Codys who complete their personal 30-day home wellness experience, convert 5+ demonstration-focused customers, establish rental subscription base in first month, and recruit their first Cody within 60 days create teams that are 5x more sustainable. Team Build Pro helps you track customer service schedules (critical for retention), organize demonstrations by customer segment, and duplicate your home wellness system as your team grows across regions.</p>
