## Changes Made

### Backend (functions/index.js)
- Renamed Firebase Functions for networking terminology:
  - `getTeam` → `getNetwork`
  - `getTeamCounts` → `getNetworkCounts`
  - `getFilteredTeam` → `getFilteredNetwork`
- Updated response data structure: changed 'downline' keys to 'network'
- Modified notification routing from '/team' to '/network'
- Maintained all existing functionality and authentication

### Frontend (lib/services/network_service.dart)

- Modified response parsing to handle 'network' data keys instead of 'downline'
- Preserved error handling and data transformation logic
- Ensured seamless integration with existing UI components

### Deployment
