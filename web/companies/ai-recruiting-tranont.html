        <h2>What Tranont Sells (in plain English)</h2>
        <p>Tranont is a Utah-based company operating in the health, wealth, and community space since 2013. On the health side, Tranont offers microbiome-focused supplements including Balance (multi-vitamin with 40+ natural vitamins, minerals, and microbiome blend), Glow (collagen supplement), Nourish (high-concentration galacto-oligosaccharides for gut health), Vibe, Life, Restore, and Defense (immune booster). The company's Daily Health System won a Gold Stevie Award in 2025.</p>
        <p>On the wealth side, Tranont provides financial empowerment tools: TaxBot (GPS-enabled expense tracking and tax preparation), Defend (identity and tax ID protection), OneView (credit monitoring), and credit repair referral services through strategic partners. Associates also have access to credit card processing and legal services.</p>
        <p class="muted">The dual-focus model means you can attract prospects from two distinct lanes: wellness-focused customers seeking gut health solutions and financially-minded individuals looking for tax optimization and credit improvement.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Markets & Footprint</h3>
          <p>Tranont operates primarily in North America with over 35,000 associates worldwide. The company is headquartered in Utah and maintains a growing international presence. The dual product focus allows flexibility across different markets—health products appeal globally while financial services resonate strongest in U.S. and tax-regulated markets.</p>
          <p class="muted">Key advantage: The health lane works cross-border while wealth services create deep U.S. market penetration.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Distribution Model</h3>
          <p>Tranont uses a binary-style compensation plan where associates build two teams or "legs." Ranks progress from Associate to Jade, Opal, Pearl, and Diamond. Key bonuses include Customer Sharing Bonus (10-30% weekly), Enrollment Launch Bonus (up to $200 per recruit), and the Jeep Bonus ($350/month for Jade/Opal, $500/month for Pearl+). Startup is $99 plus monthly subscriptions of $125-$250 depending on package.</p>
          <p class="muted">Core insight: The binary structure rewards balanced leg building—your system must work in both health and wealth lanes simultaneously.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Training & Onboarding Snapshot</h2>
        <p>Tranont emphasizes education in both health science (microbiome research, gut-brain connection) and financial literacy (tax strategies, credit optimization). New associates receive access to product training, business tools, and rank advancement roadmaps. The company provides monthly subscriptions that include training platforms and marketing resources. In 2025, Tranont's Customer Success Department won two Bronze Stevie Awards, highlighting their commitment to support systems. The challenge: most training covers product knowledge but lacks systematic follow-up automation for dual-lane recruiting.</p>

        <h2>Your AI Recruiting Playbook for Tranont</h2>
        <ol class="checklist">
          <li><strong>Dual-lane segmentation from day one.</strong> Identify prospects as health-focused (gut issues, energy, weight management) or wealth-focused (tax burden, credit concerns, financial planning). Different lanes require completely different conversation starters.</li>
          <li><strong>Health lane: microbiome storytelling.</strong> Lead with the gut-brain connection, nutrient absorption science, and before/after testimonials. Use 60-second explainer videos on how galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) support beneficial bacteria—make science simple.</li>
          <li><strong>Wealth lane: pain-point targeting.</strong> Focus on specific financial frustrations: "Are you tracking mileage manually?" (TaxBot), "Worried about identity theft?" (Defend), "Want to improve your credit score?" (credit services). Lead with the problem, not the opportunity.</li>
          <li><strong>Sample + trial strategy for health products.</strong> Offer 7-day trials or single-serving samples of Balance or Nourish with AI-automated check-ins on days 3, 7, and 14 asking about energy, digestion, and sleep quality.</li>
          <li><strong>Free audit approach for wealth services.</strong> Offer a "tax deduction audit" (what are they missing?), identity risk assessment, or credit score improvement roadmap. Position yourself as educator first, seller second.</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-selling between lanes.</strong> Health customers eventually ask about the business—introduce wealth tools as "what I use personally." Wealth customers often need energy solutions—bridge with "what keeps me sharp while building."</li>
          <li><strong>Binary-aware team building.</strong> Since Tranont uses binary compensation, train recruits to prospect in both lanes from the start. Automate invitations to virtual "Health Wednesdays" and "Wealth Fridays" so both legs grow simultaneously.</li>
          <li><strong>Compliance-first messaging.</strong> Avoid medical or income claims. Focus on experiences, education, and tools. Tranont has faced regulatory scrutiny, so your system must prioritize compliant, documented approaches over hype.</li>
          <li><strong>Rank roadmap automation.</strong> Set milestones for Jade (3 PSAs, 1,500 GV), Opal, and Pearl with AI-triggered coaching on what's needed next. Make the Jeep Bonus tangible by showing monthly progress toward qualification.</li>
          <li><strong>Duplicate the entire dual-flow.</strong> Create copy-ready health class decks and wealth webinar scripts that new associates can use immediately. Your follow-up sequences, FAQ responses, and objection handlers should work in both lanes.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="grid-2">
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Health lane (gut health/energy)</h3>
            <p>"Quick question—if I could share a 90-second video on how gut bacteria affect energy and mood, would that be helpful? It's science-based, no hype. Let me know and I'll send it."</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Wealth lane (tax optimization)</h3>
            <p>"Random question—are you tracking business mileage and expenses manually or do you have a system? I found a GPS tool that automates it all. Want a 2-minute demo?"</p>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <section class="muted">
        <p><strong>Compliance note:</strong> Stay within Tranont's policies and all applicable regulations. Avoid medical claims or income guarantees. Focus on education, personal experiences, and tool functionality. Use official Tranont product information and scientific references for health claims. Document all communications and prioritize compliant, repeatable systems over aggressive tactics.</p>
        <p>When in doubt, let the system do the heavy lifting—consistent follow-ups, dual-lane event invites, and automated education sequences work better than hype.</p>
