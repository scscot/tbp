Complete the following 3 tasks and combine the results in a single @documents/review-notes.md file. I will then cut and paste from that file.

Task 1

Create a note for the App Store Connect reviewer summarizing how we addressed the bug fix they experienced. Let them know we tested the fix on the same ios device they used:
- Device type: iPad Air (5th generation) 
- OS version: iPadOS 26.0

No need to make this too extensive, let's stick to how we fixed the bug they identified and how they can test to confirm the fix.

It might be wortwhile to let the reviewer know that the current 'approved' version of the app in the Apple Store was not configured correctly for iPhone, which is most likely why the reviewer is testing the app on the iPad. Perhaps we should let him know that the new build version 1.0.17 is configured properly and that he's welcome to test it on iPhone devices as well. I will let you decide if this should be mentioned and if so, in what context. Here's what in the Info.plist file in the version 1.0.17 build.

ðŸ“± Current Device Family Setup

  Lines 85-89:
  <key>UIDeviceFamily</key>
  <array>
      <integer>1</integer>
      <integer>2</integer>
  </array>

  Current Configuration:

  - 1 = iPhone/iPod Touch (primary)
  - 2 = iPad (secondary)

Task 2

The current description of the app that will be used in the app store listing needs to be revised to reflect the AI functionality we've implemented since our last App Store Connect review submission. Rewrite the current description (below) so that it reflects the messaging and value proposition on the Team Build Pro homepage at https://teambuildpro.com. The updated description should be roughly the same number of characters as the current description. Doesn't have to be an exact count match,just not longer if possible.

Here is the current description that needs to be rewritten, making sure it's formatted nicely and usng only text:

REFERENCE INFO

App Store Connect Review Submission

Here are the latest Review Notes provided with previous App Store Connect build submission that was rejected:

App Store Connect Reviewer Notes - Team Build Pro v1.0.16

Issue Resolution: Apple Sign-In Authentication Error

Problem Identified
The previous build (v1.0.15) was rejected due to an Apple Sign-In authentication error occurring on iPad Air (5th generation) running iPadOS 26.0. The reviewer encountered the error: "An error occurred when we tried to login using Apple."

Root Cause Analysis
Upon investigation, we identified that the Apple Sign-In implementation incorrectly included `webAuthenticationOptions` for iOS/iPadOS, which forced a web-based authentication flow instead of the native iOS flow. This caused authentication failures on iPad devices, as the web flow requires a properly configured Service ID that wasn't being used correctly.

Solution Implemented
1. Native iOS Authentication Flow
- Removed `webAuthenticationOptions` from iOS/iPadOS Apple Sign-In calls
- Implemented proper platform detection using `kIsWeb` to separate web and native flows
- Native iOS flow now uses the correct App ID configuration without web parameters

2. Enhanced Token Validation
- Added explicit null checks for `identityToken` and `authorizationCode`
- Improved error handling with clear user feedback for authentication failures
- Added Apple Sign-In availability verification before authentication attempts

3. Proper Web Flow Gating
- Web authentication now uses the correct Service ID (`com.scott.ultimatefix.auth`)
- Web flow only activated when `kIsWeb` is true, preserving native experience on iOS/iPadOS

4. Improved Button Labels for Review Experience
- Updated button text from "Sign up with Apple" to "Sign in with Apple" following Apple's design guidelines
- This clarifies that the button works for both new and returning users, reducing potential reviewer confusion
- Matches industry standard implementation that reviewers expect to see

Testing Verification
The fixes address the specific technical and user experience issues that caused the authentication failure:
- Apple Sign-In now uses the correct native iOS flow without problematic web authentication
- Button labels follow Apple's design guidelines to reduce reviewer confusion
- Implementation passes Flutter analyzer with no warnings or errors
- Ready for testing on iPad Air (5th generation) and iPadOS 26.0 environment

Additional Information
- All other authentication methods (Google Sign-In, Email/Password) remain fully functional
- The app maintains compliance with all App Store guidelines
- No changes were made to core app functionality or user experience

We appreciate your thorough review and apologize for the inconvenience. The Apple Sign-In functionality should now work correctly across all iOS devices and versions in the production environment.
