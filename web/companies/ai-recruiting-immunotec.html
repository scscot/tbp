        <h2>What Immunotec Sells (in plain English)</h2>
        <p>Immunotec is a Canadian research-driven wellness company founded in 1996, specializing in glutathione enhancement and cellular health products with 45+ years of scientific foundation. The flagship product Immunocal is a patented whey protein isolate clinically proven to raise glutathione levels—the body's master antioxidant and detoxification molecule. Immunocal holds multiple patents, is listed in the Physician's Desk Reference (PDR), and has over 30 published clinical studies. Product line extends to Immunocal Platinum (enhanced formula for aging populations), Immunocal Sport (athletic performance), antioxidant support formulas, weight management products, and science-based skincare. The company emphasizes pharmaceutical-grade manufacturing, third-party testing, and peer-reviewed research backing. Immunotec operates in 30+ countries with a scientific advisory board of immunologists, clinicians, and researchers. Products focus on immune system support, cellular health optimization, athletic recovery, and healthy aging through glutathione pathway enhancement.</p>
        <p class="muted">Immunotec's patented technology and PDR listing differentiate from commodity supplement competitors—appeal to educated consumers seeking clinically validated solutions backed by published research and medical recognition.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Who Buys Immunotec</h3>
          <p>Immunotec attracts health professionals (doctors, naturopaths, nutritionists) seeking evidence-based supplements with published clinical trials, athletes and fitness enthusiasts wanting enhanced recovery and performance optimization, aging individuals focused on cellular health and longevity strategies, individuals with compromised immune systems or chronic inflammatory conditions, and biohacking communities experimenting with glutathione enhancement. The customer base spans ages 40-75 with emphasis on educated consumers who research PubMed studies and value pharmaceutical-grade manufacturing. The business opportunity appeals to healthcare practitioners wanting credible product lines with scientific backing, wellness coaches seeking research-validated recommendations, former pharmaceutical professionals attracted by clinical rigor, international entrepreneurs (30+ countries), and individuals drawn to binary compensation offering 10% matching bonus on weaker leg volume.</p>
          <p class="muted">Strong appeal to medical professionals—Immunotec's PDR listing, published research, and patented technology provide credibility that typical MLM supplements lack, enabling healthcare practitioner endorsement.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>How Immunotec Distributes</h3>
          <p>Immunotec operates a binary compensation plan offering 10% matching bonus on weaker leg, fast start bonuses for new consultant launches, rank advancement rewards (Consultant through Presidential Diamond), luxury car program for qualifying leaders, and global expansion incentives across 30+ countries. Consultants earn through direct retail sales (buy wholesale, sell retail), preferred customer programs (subscription-based purchasing), and team building commissions on binary leg volumes. The company emphasizes scientific education over hype-driven marketing, providing clinical study summaries, research presentations, and healthcare practitioner resources. Rank progression includes multiple leadership levels with increasing binary caps and matching bonuses. Consultants can focus on retail sales to health-conscious customers or build international teams leveraging Immunotec's established country presence and scientific credibility platform.</p>
          <p class="muted">Key insight: PDR listing and published research eliminate typical MLM skepticism—consultants lead with science and clinical validation rather than testimonials, resonating with educated and professional audiences.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Training & Onboarding Snapshot</h2>
        <p>Immunotec emphasizes glutathione science education, clinical research interpretation, and medical professional engagement strategies. New Consultants learn about glutathione's role in cellular health (detoxification, immune function, antioxidant defense), Immunocal's patented bonded cysteine technology, published clinical trial results across various health conditions, and pharmaceutical-grade manufacturing standards through online training modules, scientific webinars led by advisory board members, and healthcare practitioner presentations. The company provides peer-reviewed study summaries, PDR documentation, and medical professional marketing materials. However, traditional training focuses on scientific validation and clinical education—leaving systematic digital prospecting, automated follow-up sequences targeting health-conscious audiences, social media content strategies positioning scientific credibility, and scalable customer acquisition from biohacking and wellness communities largely unaddressed. Most consultants struggle translating glutathione science into consistent customer conversations beyond existing healthcare networks.</p>

        <h2>Getting Started with Immunotec: Your First 30 Days</h2>
        <p class="muted">New to Immunotec? Here's your step-by-step roadmap to launching your Consultant journey with glutathione science and research-backed wellness:</p>
        <ol class="checklist" id="getting-started-list">
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Day 1-3: Foundation Setup</strong> — Complete your Immunotec consultant enrollment, order your starter pack with Immunocal (flagship glutathione precursor), Immunocal Platinum (enhanced aging formula), or Immunocal Sport (athletic performance), and set up your personal replicated website. Study the compensation plan structure—understand binary system with 10% matching bonus on weaker leg, fast start bonuses, rank advancement from Consultant through Presidential Diamond, and global expansion opportunities across 30+ countries. Review PDR listing and scientific advisory board credentials.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 1: Personal Glutathione Experience</strong> — Take Immunocal daily (one pouch mixed in 4oz liquid, on empty stomach for optimal absorption—follow bonded cysteine protocol for maximum glutathione synthesis). Document your daily energy levels, immune resilience, recovery time from exercise, and overall wellness observations over 7-14 days. Your personal glutathione enhancement experience becomes your strongest recruiting tool—"I started Immunocal to optimize cellular health and noticed improved workout recovery by Day 10 with sustained energy throughout the day."</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 1: Glutathione Science Deep Dive</strong> — Study glutathione's biological role—master antioxidant, cellular detoxification, immune system function, protein synthesis support. Learn Immunocal's patented bonded cysteine technology (why this delivery system raises glutathione when oral glutathione supplements fail). Review published clinical studies on PubMed: immune function trials, athletic performance research, aging studies. Master PDR listing significance and pharmaceutical-grade manufacturing standards. Build scientific foundation for educated prospect conversations.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 2: Warm Market Science Outreach</strong> — Create your contact list of 50-100 people. Segment by wellness interest: healthcare professionals (PDR-listed credibility), athletes and fitness enthusiasts (performance recovery), aging individuals (cellular health longevity), chronic condition individuals (immune support research), and biohackers (evidence-based optimization). Share your personal Week 1 glutathione experience with emphasis on published research backing. Focus on cellular health science, not disease treatment claims.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 2: Team Build Pro Setup</strong> — Download Team Build Pro to organize your prospect pipeline by wellness category (healthcare practitioners, athletes, longevity seekers, business builders), track who's engaging with your glutathione science content, and let qualified prospects start building their own teams before officially joining, so they launch with pre-built momentum in Immunotec's binary compensation structure with immediate volume positioning.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 3: First Wellness Consultations</strong> — Conduct 10-15 cellular health consultations (virtual or in-person). Share glutathione science with specific audiences: athletic recovery optimization for fitness enthusiasts, immune system support for health-conscious individuals, cellular aging strategies for longevity seekers, research-backed recommendations for healthcare practitioners. Use Immunocal's PDR listing, published clinical trials, and patented technology as credibility builders. Follow up on Day 7 (first week experience), Day 14 (two-week cellular observations), and Day 21 (reorder conversation timing).</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 3-4: First Customers & Binary Volume</strong> — Convert 5-10 consultation prospects to customers (retail purchases or preferred customer subscriptions). Focus on starter products: Immunocal (flagship glutathione precursor), Immunocal Platinum (aging population formula), Immunocal Sport (athletic performance). Establish subscription customers for recurring binary volume. Use Team Build Pro to track customer satisfaction and optimal reorder timing (typically 30-day supply cycles for consistent glutathione maintenance).</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 4: First Consultants & Binary Leg Building</strong> — Identify 1-2 serious business builders—people who achieved personal results with Immunocal products, understand glutathione science value proposition, have networks in healthcare or wellness communities, or seek international opportunity across 30+ countries. Walk them through consultant enrollment and binary leg placement strategy. Help them order starter products and schedule their first 10 cellular health consultations for Week 5. Share your scientific education system, clinical research resources, and PDR positioning strategies.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>First 30 Days: Scientific Content Strategy</strong> — Post daily "cellular health education" content on social media: glutathione science explanations, clinical study summaries, PDR significance, athletic recovery testimonials, longevity optimization tips. Share your personal supplement journey with specific cellular health observations. Use AI to schedule posts, respond to science questions with peer-reviewed study citations, and convert engagement into wellness consultations. Position yourself as the "research-backed cellular health educator" in your network.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Ongoing: Research-Based Wellness System</strong> — Use Team Build Pro to track your customer subscription cycles and binary volume contributions, identify prospects ready for glutathione education sequences, maintain consistent communication across your international team, and duplicate your scientific education system. Focus on monthly metrics: convert customers to subscriptions for recurring binary volume, maintain 5-10 active customers per consultant for sustainable income, recruit 2-3 new consultants monthly with strategic binary leg placement, and explore international markets where functional medicine and evidence-based wellness are established. Your scientific credibility combined with systematic education creates sustainable global business growth with medical professional endorsement possibilities.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> New Immunotec consultants who complete their personal 30-day glutathione experience, convert 5+ science-focused customers, build strategic binary leg placement, and recruit their first consultant within 60 days create teams that are 5x more sustainable. Team Build Pro helps you track customer subscription timing for recurring volume, organize consultations by wellness category (healthcare practitioners, athletes, longevity seekers), and duplicate your scientific education system as your international team grows across 30+ countries with PDR credibility and published research positioning.</p>

        <p><strong>Compliance note:</strong> <a href="https://immunotec.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Immunotec</a> policies prohibit disease treatment claims, medical diagnosis, and guarantees of specific health outcomes. Focus on glutathione science education, published clinical research, and general cellular health support. Use official product pages, peer-reviewed studies, PDR documentation, and approved marketing materials. When discussing business opportunity, always include income disclosure statement and clarify that results vary based on individual effort, retail vs. team building focus, binary leg placement strategy, and market conditions. Never claim products diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent disease. Emphasize Immunotec's PDR listing and published research provide credibility for educated conversations—not disease cure promises.</p>
        <p>When in doubt, let the system do the heavy lifting—consistent glutathione education, clinical research sharing, and PDR credibility work better than exaggerated health claims or aggressive income promises.</p>
