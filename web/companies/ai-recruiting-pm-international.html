        <h2>What PM-International Sells (in plain English)</h2>
        <p>PM-International is a European nutrition giant built on the FitLine brand—premium micronutrient products designed around daily routines. The flagship FitLine Optimal-Set includes Basics (morning cellular nutrition), Activize (daytime energy), and Restorate (evening recovery). Beyond the core trio, FitLine offers PowerCocktail (antioxidants), Fitness-Drink (pre-workout), and specialty products for beauty (Skin), cognition (Brain & Focus), and weight management (Protein shapes).</p>
        <p class="muted">PM-International's positioning: sports nutrition backed by anti-doping testing and Olympic athlete endorsements, making it credible for fitness enthusiasts and everyday wellness seekers alike.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Markets & Footprint</h3>
          <p>PM-International operates globally with headquarters in Luxembourg and major distribution across Europe, North America, Latin America, and Asia. The company is known for large-scale events—stadium gatherings, PM Academies, and annual celebrations that drive culture and recognition.</p>
          <p class="muted">Cross-border teams are common. Your system must work in multiple languages and time zones.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Distribution Model</h3>
          <p>PM-International uses a binary compensation plan with matching bonuses and leadership pools. Distributors earn through personal sales, team volume commissions, and advancement bonuses as they climb ranks from Team Partner to Crown Ambassador. The company emphasizes consistent activity (30-60-90 day plans) and event-driven momentum.</p>
          <p class="muted">Key insight: Habit stacking beats product lists. Tie FitLine to routines people already have.</p>

        <h2>Training & Onboarding Snapshot</h2>
        <p>PM-International emphasizes structured onboarding: 30-60-90 day plans with weekly product spotlights, team calls, and local/regional events. New distributors are taught to demo FitLine products through taste tests, before/after energy comparisons, and anti-doping certification stories. Training includes PM Academy sessions, leadership development programs, and corporate materials in multiple languages. The challenge: most reps focus on product passion, not systematic follow-up automation.</p>

        <h2>Getting Started with PM-International: Your First 30 Days</h2>
        <p class="muted">New to PM-International? Here's your step-by-step roadmap to launching your FitLine nutrition partner journey with athletic positioning and habit-stack methodology:</p>
        <ol class="checklist" id="getting-started-list">
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Day 1-3: Foundation & Personal Product Experience</strong> — Complete your PM-International enrollment and order your personal FitLine product bundle immediately (required for credibility—you cannot sell nutrition you don't personally use daily). Study the compensation plan structure (retail profit margins, team building bonuses, rank advancement milestones, international expansion opportunities). Purchase a starter package covering the core FitLine habit-stack—PowerCocktail for morning cellular nutrition, Activize for pre-workout energy and focus, Restorate for evening recovery and sleep support. Begin your personal daily routine from Day 1, documenting your experience meticulously—note morning energy improvements within 30 minutes of PowerCocktail, track workout performance and mental focus changes with Activize, monitor sleep quality and recovery feeling with Restorate. Take initial body composition photos, measure baseline energy levels (1-10 scale throughout day), track athletic performance metrics if you train (strength, endurance, recovery time). This personal transformation becomes your most authentic selling tool, so detailed documentation from the very beginning is critical.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 1: Habit-Stack Positioning & Daily Routine Mastery</strong> — Spend 7 days living the FitLine habit-stack system while learning to communicate it through simple daily routines rather than complex product names. Practice your personal morning routine—PowerCocktail mixed into water or smoothie within 30 minutes of waking, explaining this as "cellular nutrition optimization" rather than technical ingredient lists. Implement pre-workout Activize timing—consume 15-20 minutes before gym or physical activity, noting mental clarity, sustained energy without jitters, and performance enhancement. Establish evening Restorate protocol—take 30-60 minutes before bed, tracking sleep onset speed, sleep quality depth, and morning recovery feeling. Document the habit-stack experience daily in simple language prospects understand—"I wake up, drink PowerCocktail, feel energized by breakfast. Before gym, Activize gives me clean focus. Restorate at night helps me sleep deeper and wake recovered." This routine-based storytelling is far more effective than listing ingredients or technical benefits, because it shows how FitLine fits seamlessly into everyday life rather than requiring complex nutritional knowledge.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 1: Athletic Credibility & Quality Positioning</strong> — Study PM-International's unique athletic credentials and anti-doping certifications that differentiate FitLine from general wellness brands and position premium pricing. Learn the Cologne List certification—FitLine products are tested for banned substances and certified safe for Olympic and professional athletes, a credential most supplements lack. Study the Olympic athlete testimonial library—memorize 3-5 stories of athletes who use FitLine for performance, recovery, and clean nutrition they can trust for drug-tested competition. Understand the German pharmaceutical manufacturing standards—PM-International produces in facilities meeting strict European quality regulations, explaining why FitLine costs more than mass-market supplements. Review the nutrient transport concept technology—learn to explain how FitLine's delivery system optimizes cellular absorption versus standard pills and powders with lower bioavailability. Practice communicating these credentials conversationally—"FitLine is tested for banned substances so Olympic athletes can use it, which tells you the quality level" or "It's made in German pharmaceutical facilities, not generic supplement warehouses"—so you overcome price objections through quality positioning rather than discounting.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 2: Prospect List & Athletic-Minded Targeting</strong> — Create your initial prospect list of 20-30 people, prioritizing athletic, health-conscious, and performance-focused individuals who align with FitLine positioning. List active gym-goers and fitness enthusiasts—people who already invest in performance nutrition, protein powders, pre-workouts, and recovery supplements. Include amateur athletes and weekend warriors—runners, cyclists, triathletes, CrossFit participants, recreational sports players who care about training optimization. Add health-conscious professionals—people with demanding careers seeking sustained energy, mental clarity, and stress management without relying on excessive caffeine. Include aging adults focused on longevity—individuals concerned about cellular health, inflammation reduction, and maintaining vitality as they age. List parents of young athletes—families investing in youth sports who want clean, safe nutrition for their training teens. Organize your list by warmth (close friends first, acquaintances later) and by athletic engagement level (serious athletes respond to Cologne List certification, casual fitness people respond to habit-stack simplicity). This strategic targeting ensures your initial conversations have maximum relevance and conversion probability.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 2-3: Personal Transformation Documentation & Metrics</strong> — Continue your daily FitLine habit-stack while documenting observable changes and measurable improvements for authentic storytelling in presentations. Track energy patterns throughout each day—rate energy levels at wake-up, mid-morning, afternoon, evening on 1-10 scale, noting how PowerCocktail impacts morning and Restorate affects sleep-wake quality. Monitor athletic performance improvements if you train—measure workout volume, strength gains, endurance improvements, recovery time between sessions, mental focus during training. Document body composition changes—take weekly photos (same lighting, same time of day), track weight trends if relevant, note visible changes in muscle definition or body fat reduction. Record unexpected improvements—many users notice benefits beyond what they targeted, like better digestion, reduced inflammation, improved mood stability, clearer skin. Create simple visual documentation—side-by-side energy tracking charts, before-after photos if body composition changed, workout performance graphs if athletic metrics improved. Practice telling your transformation story in 90 seconds—concise narrative covering what you took, why you started, what changed, and timeline of results—because this personal experience becomes your most powerful tool for overcoming skepticism.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 3: 3-Minute Product Demo Mastery & Sampling</strong> — Develop a repeatable, simple product demonstration system using taste tests and routine walkthroughs rather than complicated presentations, making FitLine approachable and duplicatable. Create a PowerCocktail taste demo—bring samples to social situations (gym, office, friend gatherings), mix a serving while explaining "This is my morning cellular nutrition—want to try it?" Let prospects taste the natural fruit flavor, experience the pleasant texture, and ask questions in a low-pressure environment. Develop an Activize pre-workout demonstration—if you work out with friends, show them your pre-gym routine with Activize, explaining the clean energy and mental focus benefits, offering to bring them a sample for their next workout. Practice the Restorate evening recovery story—explain how you take it before bed, the ingredients supporting sleep and muscle recovery, and the difference you've noticed in sleep quality and morning feeling. Keep demonstrations under 3 minutes—you're showing how you personally use products, not delivering a lecture. Offer samples to interested prospects—PM-International provides sampling programs, or you can share from your personal supply to let people experience before committing to full packages. Schedule follow-up conversations 5-7 days after sample delivery to discuss their experience and guide toward purchase.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 3-4: First Customer Enrollments & Conversion Strategy</strong> — Convert 3-5 product demo recipients or sample users into paying customers by addressing objections and emphasizing value through quality positioning and results focus. Follow up with sample users asking specific questions—"How did you feel after taking Activize before your workout? Did you notice any energy or focus differences?" Address price objections by calculating cost-per-day compared to retail supplements ($2-4 per day for pharmaceutical-grade, athlete-tested nutrition versus buying separate products at GNC/Vitamin Shoppe with questionable quality). Emphasize the Cologne List certification for prospects concerned about ingredient safety—"This is Olympic athlete quality, not gas station supplements." Offer starter packages that include the full habit-stack (PowerCocktail, Activize, Restorate) so customers experience the complete system rather than buying single products. Guide initial usage protocols—explain morning PowerCocktail timing, pre-workout Activize dosage, evening Restorate routine—positioning yourself as their personal FitLine coach. Secure first orders through your distributor portal, explaining auto-ship options for convenience and ensuring consistent product use that generates your residual commissions. Celebrate each customer enrollment and commit to supporting their 30-day experience.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 4: Business Opportunity Introduction & Recruiting</strong> — Identify entrepreneurial prospects from your product conversations and introduce the PM-International business opportunity to 3-5 candidates, emphasizing the performance nutrition industry growth and FitLine's unique positioning. Watch for entrepreneurial signals—prospects who ask detailed questions about products, show excitement about results, mention they've told friends, or comment "I should sell this stuff!" Approach warm prospects with business curiosity—"You're loving the products—have you thought about the business side? PM-International has a distributor opportunity with 57-country reach." Share the income potential overview—explain retail profit margins, team building bonuses, rank advancement milestones, and international expansion opportunities for distributors who build globally. Highlight the athletic positioning advantage—FitLine's Cologne List certification and Olympic athlete credibility create premium pricing power and differentiation from generic wellness MLMs. Provide enrollment information and compensation plan summary, emphasizing the European company stability (founded 1993, $1+ billion annual revenue) and global infrastructure. Offer to sponsor them personally if interested—explain your support system, training access, and how they'd plug into team events. Even if no one enrolls in Week 4, planting business seeds positions you as team builder and creates future recruiting pipeline.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Day 30: Master AI Playbook & Event-Driven Systems</strong> — Implement the AI recruiting tactics from this guide to systematize demonstrations, automate follow-up, and create an event rhythm that duplicates across your future team. Build or adopt habit-stack messaging templates—communication sequences that explain FitLine through morning/pre-workout/evening routines rather than technical product details, making concepts instantly understandable. Create 3-minute spotlight demo scripts—simple, repeatable product demonstrations anyone can deliver without deep nutritional knowledge, including PowerCocktail taste tests, Activize pre-gym walkthroughs, and Restorate sleep protocols. Develop event rhythm automation—weekly team product spotlight calls (pick one product, share testimonials, conduct Q&A, invite prospects), monthly academy attendance for training and recognition, automated invitation and reminder sequences for consistent attendance. Package athletic credibility storytelling—Cologne List explanations, Olympic athlete testimonials, German pharmaceutical quality positioning—into content you can share at various prospect sophistication levels. Implement activity tracking scorecards—monitor invites sent, demos conducted, samples distributed, orders placed, so you identify patterns and optimize your approach. The goal is creating a duplicatable system where new distributors follow your event rhythm and demonstration playbook rather than inventing their own approach.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Ongoing: Event Culture & Duplication Discipline</strong> — Commit to PM-International's event-driven culture by maintaining consistent weekly team calls, monthly academy participation, and quarterly convention attendance that creates energy, recognition, and systematic team building. Host or participate in weekly spotlight calls—dedicate 20-30 minutes to featuring one product (rotation: PowerCocktail one week, Activize next, Restorate following), share customer transformation stories, answer prospect questions, extend invitations to next call. Attend monthly team academy events—corporate or upline-hosted training covering product education, sales techniques, business building strategies, and distributor recognition. Invite prospects to academy events rather than conducting one-on-one explanations—the group environment, third-party credibility, and social proof convert better than individual conversations. Participate in quarterly conventions and leadership retreats—PM-International's international events create vision, community, and momentum that fuels long-term commitment. Duplicate your upline's proven system rather than customizing—use the same presentation slides, follow-up scripts, event sequences your sponsor successfully deploys, because duplication creates team consistency and faster results. Continue your personal daily FitLine habit-stack indefinitely—your ongoing transformation and authentic product passion remain your most effective marketing tools, naturally generating referrals and recruiting interest from satisfied customers who see your sustained results.</li>
