# Plan: PreIntake.ai - Generalized Legal Intake Platform

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-27

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation: YES - Broaden scope beyond PI/California**

Market research strongly supports generalizing the intake platform to serve any legal discipline nationwide. This positions preintake.ai as a horizontal legal tech platform rather than a niche California PI tool.

## Market Research Findings

### Market Size & Growth
| Segment | 2025 Size | 2030 Projection | CAGR |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|------|
| Legal AI Software | $3.11B | $10.82B | **28.3%** |
| Legal Practice Management | $2.37B | $4.81B | 15.2% |
| US Legal Services | $396.8B | - | 2.5% |

**Key insight**: Legal AI is the fastest-growing segment at 28.3% CAGR.

### AI Adoption by Practice Area
| Practice Area | AI Adoption | Intake Complexity |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Immigration** | **47%** (highest) | Very High |
| Personal Injury | 37% | High |
| Civil Litigation | 36% | High |
| Criminal Defense | 28% | High |
| Family Law | 26% | High |
| Estate Planning | 25% | Low-Medium |

**Key insight**: Immigration lawyers are the most AI-hungry (47%) but underserved by current tools.

### Competitive Landscape
| Competitor | Model | Price | Gap |
|------------|-------|-------|-----|
| Lawmatics | CRM + intake | Custom | Generic, not practice-specific |
| Clio Grow | Intake add-on | $59/user/mo | Limited for specialized practices |
| Smith.ai | AI + human receptionist | $95-292/mo | Phone-focused, not forms |
| Generic chatbots | Widget | Varies | No legal training, high error rate |

**Key insight**: No competitor offers practice-area-specific conversational AI intake that sits *in front of* CRMs.

### Pain Points (Opportunity)
1. **60-70% of intake submissions are unqualified** - massive waste
2. **AI error rates too high** - best legal AI scores 77.9% accuracy (unacceptable)
3. **Fragmented tools** - 45% of firms use 5-10+ different technologies
4. **No 24/7 coverage** - missed leads outside business hours
5. **Generic solutions fail** - practice-specific screening needed

### Geographic Considerations
- 8 states adding privacy laws in 2025
- SOL varies by state and case type
- Bar association rules differ by jurisdiction
- **Solution**: Configurable state/jurisdiction parameters, "strictest wins" compliance

## Strategic Recommendation

### Why Broaden Scope?

1. **Higher TAM**: ~1.3M lawyers in US vs ~50K California PI lawyers
2. **Immigration opportunity**: 47% AI adoption but underserved
3. **Architecture is modular**: Already proven with PI and Tax Litigation versions
4. **Competitive differentiation**: Practice-specific beats generic
5. **Pricing power**: Specialized tools command premium

### Recommended Practice Areas (Phase 1)

| Priority | Practice Area | Why |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| 1 | Personal Injury | Existing product, high ad spend, clear ROI |
| 2 | Immigration | Highest AI adoption (47%), complex intake, multilingual need |
| 3 | Family Law | High volume, sensitive screening needed |
| 4 | Bankruptcy | Clear qualification criteria, high conversion potential |
| 5 | Criminal Defense | Time-sensitive, clear disqualifiers |

  - [x] Page discovery (attorneys, practice areas, results, testimonials)
  - [x] Attorney extraction (names, titles, bios, photos)
  - [x] Practice area extraction
  - [x] Case results extraction (verdicts, settlements)
  - [x] Testimonial extraction
  - [x] Firm info extraction (years in business, locations)
  - [x] Claude Haiku structuring for extracted data

### Phase 4: Demo Generator
- [x] Build demo generation function (`generatePreIntakeDemo`)
- [x] Create demo intake template (`/functions/templates/demo-intake.html`)
- [x] Create demo config template (`/functions/templates/demo-config.js`)
- [x] Add email validation to demo intake chat interface
- [x] Configure Firebase Storage for demo hosting
- [x] Export functions in index.js

### Phase 5: Email Notifications
- [x] Demo confirmation email to prospect (on form submission)
- [x] New lead notification to Stephen (on form submission)
- [x] Demo ready notification to Stephen with demo URL

### Phase 6: Practice Area Templates
- [x] Personal Injury (existing, used as base)
- [x] Tax/IRS (existing)
- [x] Immigration (system prompt + button detection)
- [x] Family Law (system prompt + button detection)
- [x] Bankruptcy (system prompt + button detection)
- [x] Criminal Defense (system prompt + button detection)
- [x] Estate Planning (system prompt + button detection)

### Phase 7: Dynamic Practice Area Selection
- [x] After contact info collected, ask user to select their case type
- [x] Show buttons for each practice area from self-reported breakdown (landing page form)
- [x] Skip practice area question if firm only handles one area
- [x] Branch to practice-area-specific questions based on selection
- [x] Update `detectQuestionButtons` to show firm's practice areas dynamically
- [x] Embed practice area breakdown in generated demo config

**Intake Flow (Multi-Practice Firms):**
```
1. Collect name, phone, email
2. "What type of legal matter do you need help with?"
   → [Personal Injury] [Family Law] [Bankruptcy] (firm-specific buttons)
3. Branch to selected practice area's question flow
```

**Benefits:**
- More relevant intake for multi-practice firms
- Better lead qualification (wrong practice area = disqualifier)
- Uses self-reported practice areas from landing page form (not website analysis)
- Single-practice firms skip the question (no friction)
