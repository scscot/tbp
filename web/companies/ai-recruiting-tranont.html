        <h2>What Tranont Sells (in plain English)</h2>
        <p>Tranont is a Utah-based company operating in the health, wealth, and community space since 2013. On the health side, Tranont offers microbiome-focused supplements including Balance (multi-vitamin with 40+ natural vitamins, minerals, and microbiome blend), Glow (collagen supplement), Nourish (high-concentration galacto-oligosaccharides for gut health), Vibe, Life, Restore, and Defense (immune booster). The company's Daily Health System won a Gold Stevie Award in 2025.</p>
        <p>On the wealth side, Tranont provides financial empowerment tools: TaxBot (GPS-enabled expense tracking and tax preparation), Defend (identity and tax ID protection), OneView (credit monitoring), and credit repair referral services through strategic partners. Associates also have access to credit card processing and legal services.</p>
        <p class="muted">The dual-focus model means you can attract prospects from two distinct lanes: wellness-focused customers seeking gut health solutions and financially-minded individuals looking for tax optimization and credit improvement.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Markets & Footprint</h3>
          <p>Tranont operates primarily in North America with over 35,000 associates worldwide. The company is headquartered in Utah and maintains a growing international presence. The dual product focus allows flexibility across different markets—health products appeal globally while financial services resonate strongest in U.S. and tax-regulated markets.</p>
          <p class="muted">Key advantage: The health lane works cross-border while wealth services create deep U.S. market penetration.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Distribution Model</h3>
          <p>Tranont uses a binary-style compensation plan where associates build two teams or "legs." Ranks progress from Associate to Jade, Opal, Pearl, and Diamond. Key bonuses include Customer Sharing Bonus (10-30% weekly), Enrollment Launch Bonus (up to $200 per recruit), and the Jeep Bonus ($350/month for Jade/Opal, $500/month for Pearl+). Startup is $99 plus monthly subscriptions of $125-$250 depending on package.</p>
          <p class="muted">Core insight: The binary structure rewards balanced leg building—your system must work in both health and wealth lanes simultaneously.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <section>
        <h2>Training & Onboarding Snapshot</h2>
        <p>Tranont emphasizes education in both health science (microbiome research, gut-brain connection) and financial literacy (tax strategies, credit optimization). New associates receive access to product training, business tools, and rank advancement roadmaps. The company provides monthly subscriptions that include training platforms and marketing resources. In 2025, Tranont's Customer Success Department won two Bronze Stevie Awards, highlighting their commitment to support systems. The challenge: most training covers product knowledge but lacks systematic follow-up automation for dual-lane recruiting.</p>

        <h2>Your AI Recruiting Playbook for Tranont</h2>
        <ol class="checklist" id="getting-started-list">
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Dual-lane segmentation from day one.</strong> Identify prospects as health-focused (gut issues, energy, weight management) or wealth-focused (tax burden, credit concerns, financial planning). Different lanes require completely different conversation starters.</li>
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Health lane: microbiome storytelling.</strong> Lead with the gut-brain connection, nutrient absorption science, and before/after testimonials. Use 60-second explainer videos on how galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) support beneficial bacteria—make science simple.</li>
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Wealth lane: pain-point targeting.</strong> Focus on specific financial frustrations: "Are you tracking mileage manually?" (TaxBot), "Worried about identity theft?" (Defend), "Want to improve your credit score?" (credit services). Lead with the problem, not the opportunity.</li>
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Sample + trial strategy for health products.</strong> Offer 7-day trials or single-serving samples of Balance or Nourish with AI-automated check-ins on days 3, 7, and 14 asking about energy, digestion, and sleep quality.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Free audit approach for wealth services.</strong> Offer a "tax deduction audit" (what are they missing?), identity risk assessment, or credit score improvement roadmap. Position yourself as educator first, seller second.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Cross-selling between lanes.</strong> Health customers eventually ask about the business—introduce wealth tools as "what I use personally." Wealth customers often need energy solutions—bridge with "what keeps me sharp while building."</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Binary-aware team building.</strong> Since Tranont uses binary compensation, train recruits to prospect in both lanes from the start. Automate invitations to virtual "Health Wednesdays" and "Wealth Fridays" so both legs grow simultaneously.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Compliance-first messaging.</strong> Avoid medical or income claims. Focus on experiences, education, and tools. Tranont has faced regulatory scrutiny, so your system must prioritize compliant, documented approaches over hype.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Rank roadmap automation.</strong> Set milestones for Jade (3 PSAs, 1,500 GV), Opal, and Pearl with AI-triggered coaching on what's needed next. Make the Jeep Bonus tangible by showing monthly progress toward qualification.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Duplicate the entire dual-flow.</strong> Create copy-ready health class decks and wealth webinar scripts that new associates can use immediately. Your follow-up sequences, FAQ responses, and objection handlers should work in both lanes.</li>
        </ol>

      <section>
        <h2>Getting Started with Tranont: Your First 30 Days</h2>
        <p class="muted">New to Tranont? Here's your step-by-step roadmap to launching your Associate journey with dual-focus health and financial empowerment:</p>
        <ol class="checklist" id="getting-started-list">
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Day 1-3: Foundation & Dual-Lane Setup</strong> — Complete your Tranont Associate enrollment ($99), choose your monthly subscription package ($125-250 depending on level), order your personal product starter pack (recommend Balance multi-vitamin, Nourish GOS supplement, plus TaxBot app for personal tax tracking), and set up your replicated website. Study the binary compensation plan—understand two-leg structure, Customer Sharing Bonus (10-30% weekly), Enrollment Launch Bonus (up to $200 per recruit), rank progression from Associate to Jade/Opal/Pearl/Diamond, and the Jeep Bonus ($350-500/month at higher ranks).</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 1: Personal Dual-Lane Experience</strong> — Begin your own 30-day protocol with Balance daily multivitamin and Nourish galacto-oligosaccharides for gut health—take as directed and document energy, digestion, and overall wellness observations after 7 days. Simultaneously, use TaxBot to track your business mileage and expenses for the week—experience the GPS automation personally. Your dual-lane personal experience becomes your recruiting asset—"I'm using Balance for gut health AND TaxBot for tax deductions—here's what I've noticed."</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 1: Dual-Focus Education</strong> — Study both sides: Health lane—microbiome science, gut-brain connection, Balance's 40+ vitamins and minerals, Nourish's galacto-oligosaccharides for beneficial bacteria, and Gold Stevie Award-winning Daily Health System. Wealth lane—TaxBot GPS expense tracking, Defend identity protection, OneView credit monitoring, tax optimization strategies, and credit improvement basics. Master the positioning: health for wellness seekers, wealth for financial optimizers.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 2: Dual-Lane Warm Market Outreach</strong> — Create your contact list of 50-100 people, then segment into two distinct lanes. Health lane: gut health concerns, energy seekers, weight management goals, supplement buyers, wellness advocates. Wealth lane: self-employed/small business owners needing tax tracking, people worried about identity theft, individuals wanting to improve credit scores, financial optimization seekers. Share your personal Week 1 experience in both lanes with appropriate contacts—health results to wellness contacts, TaxBot convenience to business owners.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 2: Team Build Pro Setup</strong> — Download Team Build Pro to organize your prospect pipeline by lane (health vs wealth), track who's engaged with your microbiome education vs tax strategy content, and let qualified prospects start building their own teams before officially joining, so they launch with pre-built momentum in their chosen lane (or both).</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 3: First Dual-Lane Consultations</strong> — Conduct 10-15 consultations total split across both lanes. Health consultations: virtual wellness assessments identifying gut health, energy, digestion needs—recommend Balance/Nourish with 7-day trial periods and follow-up check-ins. Wealth consultations: tax deduction audits for business owners, identity risk assessments, credit score improvement roadmaps—offer free TaxBot trial or Defend information. Master lane-appropriate positioning—health is personal transformation, wealth is practical tools.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 3-4: First Customers & Binary Leg Building</strong> — Convert 5-10 customers split between lanes (aim for 3-5 health product subscribers, 2-5 wealth service users) with monthly subscriptions. Track which lane each customer fits—you're building both legs of your binary simultaneously. Set up automatic follow-ups: health customers get day 14 wellness check-ins, wealth customers get quarterly tax strategy tips. Balance your binary legs early—don't over-index on one lane.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 4: First Associates (Binary-Aware)</strong> — Identify 2-3 serious business builders—ideally one health-focused, one wealth-focused, maintaining binary balance. People experiencing personal results from Balance/Nourish (health) or saving money with TaxBot (wealth), understanding the binary compensation advantage, and having networks in wellness or financial optimization communities. Walk them through Associate enrollment. Help them choose their lane focus and plan their first 10 consultations for Week 5. Share your lane-specific scripts and dual-flow system.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>First 30 Days: Dual-Lane Playbook Duplication</strong> — Package your entire system for both lanes. Health lane: gut health assessment questionnaire, microbiome science explainer (simple, not textbook), Balance/Nourish benefits one-pager, 7-day trial follow-up templates. Wealth lane: tax deduction audit template, TaxBot benefit calculator, Defend identity protection guide, credit optimization roadmap. Binary compensation explanation with both-lane growth importance. New Associates can start consultations in their strong lane within 48 hours.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Ongoing: Binary-Balanced Team Growth</strong> — Use Team Build Pro to track your organization's customer reorder rates by lane, identify Associates hitting Jade/Opal/Pearl milestones, maintain consistent communication across your binary legs, and share the dual-focus positioning that differentiates Tranont from single-product MLMs. The binary structure rewards balanced leg building—your system must develop both health and wealth lanes simultaneously. Track Jeep Bonus progress milestones to keep team motivated toward tangible rewards.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> New Tranont Associates who master both personal health and wealth experiences, convert 5+ customers split between lanes, and understand binary leg balancing within 60 days build teams with 4x higher retention. Team Build Pro helps you track dual-lane consultations, organize by health vs wealth interest, and duplicate your balanced system as your binary team grows.</p>

            <p>"Quick question—if I could share a 90-second video on how gut bacteria affect energy and mood, would that be helpful? It's science-based, no hype. Let me know and I'll send it."</p>

            <h3>Business builder (dual-lane pitch)</h3>
            <p>"Our team runs two weekly virtual events: Health Wednesdays (gut science + supplements) and Wealth Fridays (tax strategies + credit tips). Both have plug-and-play follow-up systems. Want to sit in on one and see if it fits your network?"</p>
