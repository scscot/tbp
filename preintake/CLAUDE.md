## Product Overview

### The Problem

Law firm intake staff spend hours qualifying leads that never sign. Meanwhile, real cases slip through because generic forms can't distinguish a strong case from a dead end.

**The math:**
- 60-70% of intake form submissions are unqualified
- Each unqualified call costs $25-50 in staff time
- Time-sensitive cases get lost in the noise
- 45% of law firms use 5-10+ fragmented technologies

Generic contact forms and chatbots don't solve this. They just flood your inbox faster—with no legal training and high error rates.

### The Solution

**AI that reviews inquiries like your best paralegal.**

Every inquiry delivered with a complete case summary, qualification assessment, and recommendation—ready for your review.

Unlike traditional forms or CRM intake tools, PreIntake.ai conducts a real conversation. It asks the right questions, adapts based on answers, and pre-evaluates every case before staff review:

| Routing | What It Means | What Happens |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| **GREEN** | Strong case indicators | → Priority follow-up recommended |
| **YELLOW** | Needs documentation | → Queued for records review |
| **RED** | Cannot help | → Polite decline with resources |

**All inquiries are delivered to your team**—but each arrives pre-screened with a clear assessment and recommended action, so staff time goes to viable matters.

**Zero Data Retention** — Inquiries are processed and delivered immediately, never stored on our servers.

### How It's Different

**This is not another form builder or CRM.**

| Feature | Form Builders / CRMs | PreIntake.ai |
|---------|---------------------|--------------|
| Intake style | Static forms, fixed fields | Conversational AI that adapts to each case type |
| Screening | Generic lead scoring | Practice-area-specific legal screening |
| Disqualification | Manual review required | Instant (SOL, jurisdiction, conflicts, representation) |
| Output | Raw form data | Routing decision + plain-English rationale |
| Integration | Replaces your system | Feeds INTO your existing CRM |

**We sit in front of Lawmatics, Clio, or Filevine—not instead of them.**

Your CRM manages leads. We make sure only real cases get there in the first place.

## Practice Areas Supported

**PreIntake.ai works with ANY legal practice area.** The system uses a flexible template architecture that adapts to any type of law firm.

### How It Works

1. **Specialized Templates**: Common practice areas have pre-built screening logic with practice-specific questions and qualification criteria
2. **Generic Template**: Any practice area not in the specialized list uses an intelligent generic template that adapts the conversation to that practice type
3. **Custom Configuration**: Firms can add any practice areas during setup—the system dynamically generates appropriate intake flows

### Practice Areas with Specialized Screening

These areas have deep, practice-specific question flows and qualification criteria:

| Practice Area | Key Screening Criteria |
|---------------|----------------------|
| **Personal Injury** | SOL, fault, injuries, insurance, existing representation |
| **Immigration** | Visa status, timeline, bars to admission, prior violations |
| **Family Law** | Jurisdiction, minor children, assets, urgency |
| **Bankruptcy** | Income, debt type, prior filings, asset protection |
| **Criminal Defense** | Charges, court dates, bail status, existing representation |
| **Tax/IRS** | Tax type, amount at stake, procedural posture |
| **Estate Planning** | Asset complexity, family dynamics, urgency |
| **Employment Law** | Discrimination type, timeline, documentation |
| **Workers' Compensation** | Injury type, employer response, medical treatment |
| **Real Estate** | Transaction type, timeline, disputes |

### Other Practice Areas

Any practice area not listed above (e.g., IP, Civil Litigation, Business Law, Entertainment Law, etc.) uses the generic template with:
- Standard contact collection
- Practice-type-aware case description questions
- Dynamic follow-up questions based on responses
- Universal qualification criteria (jurisdiction, representation status, urgency)

The generic template leverages Claude AI to ask intelligent follow-up questions relevant to the specific legal matter described.

## 3-Gate Screening Process

**Customized Per Practice Area**

### Gate 1: Hard Disqualifiers (< 60 seconds)
- Statute of limitations / deadline checks
- Jurisdiction verification
- Conflict of interest screening
- Existing representation check

### Gate 2: Case Strength Assessment
- Practice-specific liability/merit indicators
- Documentation and evidence availability
- Timeline and urgency factors

### Gate 3: Practical Viability
- Financial exposure vs. recovery potential
- Complexity assessment
- Collectability / ability to pay

**Output**: Structured data with routing recommendation, urgency flag, and plain-English rationale—delivered to your CRM automatically via webhook.

## Pricing

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| **One-time Setup Fee** | $149 |
| **Monthly Subscription** | $99/mo |
| **Total Due Today** | **$248** |

### Setup Fee Includes:
- Practice-area template configuration
- Firm branding (logo, colors, messaging)
- Email delivery setup (webhook/CRM optional)
- Compliance review for your jurisdiction
- Working demo for approval

### Monthly Subscription Includes:
- Hosting and AI infrastructure
- Unlimited intakes
- Email support

**No long-term contracts.** Cancel anytime.

### The Math (ROI)

When you're spending $300-500 per lead, even small conversion improvements mean real money.

**Example scenario:**
- Current: 100 leads/month, 30 qualified, 10 consults, 5 signed
- After: 100 leads/month, 40 qualified*, 18 consults, 9 signed

*Not more qualified leads—better identification of existing qualified leads.*

**Result:** 4 additional signed cases/month × $15K average fee = **$60K incremental revenue**

**Your cost:** $99/month

**ROI:** 465:1

## Market Research

### Market Size & Growth

| Segment | 2025 Size | 2030 Projection | CAGR |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|------|
| Legal AI Software | $3.11B | $10.82B | **28.3%** |
| Legal Practice Management | $2.37B | $4.81B | 15.2% |
| US Legal Services | $396.8B | - | 2.5% |

**Key insight**: Legal AI is the fastest-growing segment at 28.3% CAGR.

### AI Adoption by Practice Area

| Practice Area | AI Adoption | Intake Complexity |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Immigration** | **47%** (highest) | Very High |
| Personal Injury | 37% | High |
| Civil Litigation | 36% | High |
| Criminal Defense | 28% | High |
| Family Law | 26% | High |
| Estate Planning | 25% | Low-Medium |

**Key insight**: Immigration lawyers are the most AI-hungry (47%) but underserved by current tools.

### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Model | Price | Gap |
|------------|-------|-------|-----|
| Lawmatics | CRM + intake | Custom | Generic, not practice-specific |
| Clio Grow | Intake add-on | $59/user/mo | Limited for specialized practices |
| Smith.ai | AI + human receptionist | $95-292/mo | Phone-focused, not forms |
| Generic chatbots | Widget | Varies | No legal training, high error rate |

**Key insight**: No competitor offers practice-area-specific conversational AI intake that sits *in front of* CRMs.

### Pain Points (Opportunity)

1. **60-70% of intake submissions are unqualified** - massive waste
2. **AI error rates too high** - best legal AI scores 77.9% accuracy (unacceptable)
3. **Fragmented tools** - 45% of firms use 5-10+ different technologies
4. **No 24/7 coverage** - missed leads outside business hours
5. **Generic solutions fail** - practice-specific screening needed

### Geographic Considerations

- 8 states adding privacy laws in 2025
- SOL varies by state and case type
- Bar association rules differ by jurisdiction
- **Solution**: Configurable state/jurisdiction parameters, "strictest wins" compliance

## Strategic Recommendations

### Why Broaden Scope?

1. **Higher TAM**: ~1.3M lawyers in US vs ~50K California PI lawyers
2. **Immigration opportunity**: 47% AI adoption but underserved
3. **Architecture is modular**: Already proven with PI and Tax Litigation versions
4. **Competitive differentiation**: Practice-specific beats generic
5. **Pricing power**: Specialized tools command premium

### Recommended Practice Areas (Phase 1)

| Priority | Practice Area | Why |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| 1 | Personal Injury | Existing product, high ad spend, clear ROI |
| 2 | Immigration | Highest AI adoption (47%), complex intake, multilingual need |
| 3 | Family Law | High volume, sensitive screening needed |
| 4 | Bankruptcy | Clear qualification criteria, high conversion potential |
| 5 | Criminal Defense | Time-sensitive, clear disqualifiers |

| `subjectLine` | Subject line used |
| `templateVersion` | Template version (v4-generic) |
| `randomIndex` | Random number for shuffled sending order |
| `failReason` | (optional) Reason for failure if status is `failed` |

**Data Quality Policy:**
- Valid status values are ONLY: `pending`, `sent`, `failed`, `unsubscribed`
- Records with invalid/corrupt data should be **deleted**, not marked with special status values
- The `audit-preintake-emails.js` script validates data integrity before campaign runs
- If a record cannot be sent (bad data, missing required fields), delete it or set `status: 'failed'` with `failReason`

  - Falls back to `BATCH_SIZE` environment variable if Firestore value not set

    - Week 1: 5 emails/batch
    - Week 2: 10 emails/batch
    - Week 3: 20 emails/batch
    - Week 4: 40 emails/batch

  - Renamed from "Email Campaign Analytics" to "Campaign Analytics"
  - Migrated backend from Mailgun API to GA4 Data API

  - Fetches overview metrics (7-day, today, yesterday) and traffic source breakdown

### Phase 48: Scraper Performance Optimization (2026-01-30)
- [x] **Pre-loaded Email Deduplication** - Implemented in Kentucky Bar scraper
  - Replaced individual Firestore queries with in-memory Set lookup (O(1) vs O(n))
  - New functions: `preloadExistingEmails()`, `emailExists()`, `markEmailAsInserted()`
  - Loads all existing emails at startup (~17K records in ~2-3 seconds)
  - Eliminates per-profile Firestore roundtrip that caused 90-minute timeout
  - Expected 5-10x speedup for scrapers with high duplicate rates
  - Pattern can be applied to other scrapers experiencing timeout issues

**Pre-loaded Email Deduplication Pattern:**
```javascript
// In-memory Set of existing emails for fast lookup
let existingEmailsSet = null;

async function preloadExistingEmails() {
    existingEmailsSet = new Set();
    const snapshot = await db.collection('preintake_emails')
        .select('email')  // Only fetch email field
        .get();
    snapshot.forEach(doc => {
        const email = doc.data().email;
        if (email) existingEmailsSet.add(email.toLowerCase());
    });
}

function emailExists(email) {
    return existingEmailsSet.has(email.toLowerCase());
}

function markEmailAsInserted(email) {
    if (existingEmailsSet) existingEmailsSet.add(email.toLowerCase());
}
```

### Phase 49: Email Campaign User Flow Analysis (2026-01-31)
- [x] **User Flow Audit** - Analyzed `send-preintake-campaign.js` conversion funnel
  - Email click rate: 10.9% (solid for cold outreach)
  - Visit-to-view rate: 25% (intentional design - allows brand validation)
  - Homepage bounce rate: 70.3%
- [x] **Verified Design Decisions**
  - Auto-open demo intentionally reverted to allow brand validation
  - `?autoopen=true` parameter exists but only used for "View Demo Again" button
  - Campaign visitors see "Begin Your Custom Demo" CTA after page load
- [x] **Bar Profile Personalization Confirmed**
  - `generateBarProfileDemoForContact()` creates demos branded with attorney name + practice area
  - Subject line "I built you a personalized intake demo" is accurate
- [x] **Generic Fallback Phased Out**
  - Query logic only fetches contacts with `website != ''` OR `domainChecked == true`
  - 68 v6-generic emails in analytics are legacy from before bar profile system

**Email Campaign User Flow (Current Architecture):**
```
Email Sent → Link Clicked → Homepage Loads → "Begin Your Custom Demo" CTA → Demo Started → Intake Completed
                                 ↓
                       Welcome Banner + CTA Transform
```

**Campaign Visitor Detection (index.html):**
- `?demo={leadId}` triggers campaign mode
- Welcome banner: "Welcome [FirmName]" shown immediately
- Hero CTA changed to "Begin Your Custom Demo"
- Demo modal opens on CTA click (not auto-open)
- Exit confirmation modal prevents abandonment
- `?autoopen=true` exists for "View Demo Again" only

**Template Distribution (as of 2026-01-31):**
| Template | Purpose | Usage |
|----------|---------|-------|
| v7-bar-profile-demo | Bar contacts (no website) | 62% |
| v6-personalized-demo | Website contacts | 19% |
| v6-generic | Fallback (legacy) | 19% |

**Tracking Flow:**
1. `trackDemoView?type=visit` - On page load with `?demo=`
2. `trackDemoView?type=view` - On "Start Demo" click (via postMessage from iframe)
3. `sessionStorage.tbp_demo_viewed` - Header CTA becomes "Get Started →"

**Conclusion:** Current flow is well-optimized. No changes needed.

### Phase 50: Welcome Banner CTA & Daily Email Sending (2026-01-31)
- [x] **Welcome Banner CTA** - Made banner actionable for campaign visitors
  - Banner now shows: "Welcome, [Name] — Your demo is ready [Start Now →]"
  - CTA button triggers `openDemoModal()` directly from banner
  - Suffix and CTA hidden by default, shown only for `?demo=` visitors
  - `cleanFirmNameForDisplay()` strips ", Attorney at Law" suffix for bar profile contacts
  - CSS: Flexbox layout, white button text on dark background, responsive mobile styling
- [x] **Daily Email Sending** - Changed from Mon-Fri to 7 days/week
  - Updated `send-preintake-campaign.js` allowedDays from `[1,2,3,4,5]` to `[0,1,2,3,4,5,6]`
  - Workflow was already configured for daily runs (`* * *` cron pattern)

**Banner Display Logic:**
| Visitor Type | Banner Display |
|--------------|----------------|
| `?demo=` (campaign with demo) | "Welcome, Smith & Associates — Your demo is ready [Start Now →]" |
| `?demo=` (bar profile, no firm) | "Welcome, John Smith — Your demo is ready [Start Now →]" |
| `?firm=` (no demo yet) | "Welcome, Smith & Associates" (no suffix/CTA) |
| `?completed=` (finished demo) | "Welcome, Smith & Associates" (no suffix/CTA) |

- Fake domain blocking
- Session recovery with 24-hour TTL
- Deduplication (prevents duplicate submissions)

---

## Demo Generation Flow

1. **Lead submits form** → `submitDemoRequest` function
2. **Validation passes** → Store in Firestore with status `pending`
3. **Confirmation email** → Sent to prospect immediately
4. **New lead notification** → Sent to Stephen
5. **Analysis triggers** → `analyzePreIntakeLead` (Firestore onCreate)
6. **Website scraped** → Extract firm name, practice areas, branding
7. **Deep research runs** → `performDeepResearch`
8. **Additional pages scraped** → Attorneys, case results, testimonials
9. **Claude structures data** → Using Haiku for cost efficiency
10. **Demo generated** → `generatePreIntakeDemo` (Firestore onUpdate)
11. **HTML uploaded** → Firebase Storage at `preintake-demos/{leadId}/index.html`
12. **Demo ready emails** → Sent to BOTH prospect (`sendProspectDemoReadyEmail`) AND Stephen

---

## Lead Delivery Configuration

### Strategy: Default to Email, Upgrade Later

**Rationale:** Minimize friction at checkout. Get customers activated immediately, then offer CRM integration as a post-activation enhancement.

**Flow:**
```
1. Customer pays → Account activated → Inquires delivered via EMAIL (default)
2. Welcome email includes: Embed code + "Configure CRM Integration" link
3. Customer can optionally set up CRM/webhook delivery later
```

### Delivery Methods

| Method | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Email** (Default) | HTML summary to firm's intake email | ✅ Implemented |
| **Webhook** | POST JSON to custom URL (Zapier-compatible) | ✅ Implemented |
| **Native CRM** | Direct API integration | 🔮 Future |

---

## CRM Integration Research

**PreIntake.ai sits in front of intake CRMs** (Lawmatics, Clio Grow, Filevine) — we're a gatekeeper, not a data janitor.

**Current State:**
- Email delivery (default) ✅
- Webhook delivery (Zapier, custom integrations) ✅
- **This covers ~80% of buyers today**

**Build Criteria:** Don't build native CRM integrations until 5+ paying customers request the same one.

---

## Compliance

### Built-in Protections
- No attorney-client relationship disclaimer (ethics-rule compliant)
- AI usage disclosure (aligned with state bar guidance)
- Confidentiality boundaries pre-engagement
- Decline messaging that avoids unauthorized practice of law
- Data retention and deletion capability
- HTTPS encryption, US-based hosting

### Configurable by Jurisdiction
Our system adapts disclaimers and screening logic to each state's requirements. Multi-state firms get automatic routing based on case location.

### Data Privacy
- PreIntake.ai does NOT retain client data
- All intake information is immediately delivered and discarded
- CCPA/GDPR compliance statements in Privacy Policy
- Third-party services disclosed (Stripe, Claude AI, Firebase)

---

## Deployment Model

**We host everything. Customers focus on cases.**

Intake runs on our infrastructure:
- Dedicated URL (e.g., `intake.smithlaw.com` via CNAME, or `smithlaw.preintake.ai`)
- We manage the AI, hosting, security, and updates
- Customer provides branding assets and webhook endpoint
- Updates and improvements deploy automatically

**Why this model:**
1. We can prove ROI with real conversion data
2. Bug fixes and improvements benefit all clients instantly
3. No IT burden on law firms
4. Compliance updates happen automatically

For firms with strict data residency requirements, self-hosted option at custom pricing.

## Current Gaps & Future Improvements

**Recently Completed:**
- ✅ Post-intake conversion email (Phase 17) - Sends after first demo lead delivery
- ✅ Demo ready notification to customer - Sends via `sendProspectDemoReadyEmail()` when demo is generated
- ✅ Customer Portal - `account.html` with magic link auth, settings management, Stripe billing portal
- ✅ Analytics Dashboard - `email-analytics.html` with GA4 integration, email stats, A/B test tracking, engagement funnel
- ✅ Demo Expiration - `cleanup-stale-demos.js` auto-deletes 31+ day old unconverted demos (daily workflow)
- ✅ A/B Testing (Subject Lines) - Subject line variants tracked via `subjectTag` field with dashboard reporting

| Gap | Current State | Planned Solution | Priority |
|-----|---------------|------------------|----------|
| CRM integrations | Email/webhook only (covers 80%) | Native integrations when 5+ customers request same CRM | Low (deferred) |
| Multi-language support | English only | Spanish, Chinese intake options | Low |
| A/B testing (question flows) | Subject lines only | Question flow optimization | Low |

## Known Issues & Historical Notes

### UTM Parameter "bhgefbdu" in GA4 (Jan 2026)
GA4 shows 7 users from `email/bhgefbdu` - a corrupted UTM medium parameter. Investigation confirmed:
- Current code correctly uses `utm_medium=outreach` with proper `encodeURIComponent()` encoding
- The "bhgefbdu" entries are legacy from before Mailgun tracking was disabled (Jan 2026)
- Mailgun's click tracking rewrote URLs before they were delivered, causing corruption
- **No fix needed** - these entries will naturally age out of GA4's 14-month retention window
- Current tracking uses Firestore-based `trackDemoView` (visit on page load, view on "Start Demo" click)
