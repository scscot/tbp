# App Store Connect Reviewer Notes - Team Build Pro v1.0.16

## Issue Resolution: Apple Sign-In Authentication Error

### Problem Identified
The previous build (v1.0.15) was rejected due to an Apple Sign-In authentication error occurring on iPad Air (5th generation) running iPadOS 26.0. The reviewer encountered the error: "An error occurred when we tried to login using Apple."

### Root Cause Analysis
Upon investigation, we identified that the Apple Sign-In implementation incorrectly included `webAuthenticationOptions` for iOS/iPadOS, which forced a web-based authentication flow instead of the native iOS flow. This caused authentication failures on iPad devices, as the web flow requires a properly configured Service ID that wasn't being used correctly.

### Solution Implemented
**1. Native iOS Authentication Flow**
- Removed `webAuthenticationOptions` from iOS/iPadOS Apple Sign-In calls
- Implemented proper platform detection using `kIsWeb` to separate web and native flows
- Native iOS flow now uses the correct App ID configuration without web parameters

**2. Enhanced Token Validation**
- Added explicit null checks for `identityToken` and `authorizationCode`
- Improved error handling with clear user feedback for authentication failures
- Added Apple Sign-In availability verification before authentication attempts

**3. Proper Web Flow Gating**
- Web authentication now uses the correct Service ID (`com.scott.ultimatefix.auth`)
- Web flow only activated when `kIsWeb` is true, preserving native experience on iOS/iPadOS

### Testing Verification
The fix addresses the specific production environment mismatch that caused the authentication failure. Apple Sign-In now uses the correct production configuration that aligns with App Store Connect's review environment.

### Additional Information
- All other authentication methods (Google Sign-In, Email/Password) remain fully functional
- The app maintains compliance with all App Store guidelines
- No changes were made to core app functionality or user experience

**We appreciate your thorough review and apologize for the inconvenience. The Apple Sign-In functionality should now work correctly across all iOS devices and versions in the production environment.**
