        <h2>What Farmasi Sells (in plain English)</h2>
        <p>Farmasi is a Turkish-based beauty and personal care company offering cosmetics, skincare, fragrance, and home care products through a catalog model. The flagship lines include Make-up color cosmetics (foundations, lipsticks, eyeshadows with extensive shade ranges), Dr. C. Tuna skincare (dermatologically tested formulations), fragrances (designer-inspired scents at accessible prices), and Tunaskin professional skin care. Additional categories include body care, hair care, men's grooming, baby care, and home cleaning products. Founded in 1950, Farmasi emphasizes Turkish beauty heritage, dermatologist-developed formulas, and affordable luxury positioning.</p>
        <p class="muted">Key positioning: Catalog beauty with shade variety—think Avon meets Sephora at direct-selling prices.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Markets & Footprint</h3>
          <p>Farmasi operates globally with presence in North America (USA, Canada), Europe, Latin America, and expanding internationally. The company leverages digital catalogs, social selling tactics, and beauty party models. Farmasi is particularly strong among beauty influencers, makeup enthusiasts, and entrepreneurs seeking flexible income streams through catalog sales.</p>
          <p class="muted">Catalog-driven model means your recruiting must work through visual demonstrations and shade-matching.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Distribution Model</h3>
          <p>Farmasi uses a unilevel compensation plan with fast-start bonuses and team overrides. Beauty Influencers earn through retail sales commissions (typically 20-25% margins), team volume bonuses, and rank advancement incentives. The company emphasizes party-based selling (virtual or in-person), sampling strategies, and social media content creation. Monthly personal sales requirements are minimal, focusing instead on customer acquisition.</p>
          <p class="muted">Key insight: Shade matching beats product lists. Start with foundation/lipstick matching, expand from there.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Training & Onboarding Snapshot</h2>
        <p>Farmasi emphasizes catalog party training with sampling kits, virtual event hosting, and social media content calendars. New Beauty Influencers are taught shade-matching techniques (ask for selfie in natural light), bundle by look strategies (work/weekend/glam), and simple reorder workflows. Corporate training includes catalog navigation, compliance basics (avoid medical claims), and team duplication systems. The challenge: converting party attendees into consistent customers requires automated follow-up and sample tracking.</p>

        <h2>Your AI Recruiting Playbook for Farmasi</h2>
        <ol class="checklist">
          <li><strong>Lead with shade matching.</strong> Ask for a selfie in natural window light. AI analyzes and suggests foundation/lipstick shades from catalog. This beats generic invites.</li>
          <li><strong>15-minute mini lives.</strong> Short product demos (one look, 3-4 products) work better than hour-long catalog overviews. AI scripts these quick demos.</li>
          <li><strong>Bundle by look automation.</strong> Work look (neutral palette + long-wear foundation), weekend casual (tinted moisturizer + lip stain), glam night (smokey eye + bold lip). AI builds carts.</li>
          <li><strong>Sampling rules system.</strong> Match shade before mailing samples. AI tracks who got what, when to follow up, and what questions to ask.</li>
          <li><strong>Weekly party + Q&A rhythm.</strong> One demo, one Q&A session per week. AI generates invites, reminders, and post-event cart links.</li>
          <li><strong>Referral ask timing.</strong> After first purchase success, ask "Who are two friends who love makeup?" AI scripts the exact referral message.</li>
          <li><strong>Duplicate the party pack.</strong> Save your demo scripts, look bundles, and follow-up sequences so new Influencers can host in 48 hours.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Getting Started with Farmasi: Your First 30 Days</h2>
        <p class="muted">New to Farmasi? Here's your step-by-step roadmap to launching your Turkish beauty catalog journey with affordable cosmetics and skincare:</p>
        <ol class="checklist">
          <li><strong>Day 1-3: Foundation & Product Selection</strong> — Complete your Farmasi Beauty Influencer enrollment and order your starter kit plus personal products matching your beauty routine. Study the compensation plan (retail profit margins, team building bonuses, rank advancement). Review the full catalog—makeup, skincare, personal care, fragrances, accessories. Choose 10-15 products you'll personally use and become expert in based on your beauty preferences and skin type. Install Farmasi's mobile app for catalog access, party booking, and order management.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 1: Personal Product Testing & Shade Matching</strong> — Spend 7 days testing your Farmasi products and documenting your experience. Critical focus: shade matching for foundations, concealers, and lip colors—photograph yourself in natural light wearing different shades to understand undertones and formulations. Test product longevity (how foundation wears through the day), blendability, pigmentation, packaging quality. Compare Farmasi quality and pricing to drugstore and high-end brands you've used—document honest comparisons for credible recommendations. Learn Farmasi's unique positioning: Turkish-manufactured quality at prices 50-70% below comparable brands.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 2: Party Format Development & Demo Rehearsal</strong> — Study Farmasi's party-based sales model—understand virtual parties, in-home demos, Facebook live formats, and hybrid approaches. Develop your signature party format: 15-30 minute makeup tutorials showcasing specific looks (everyday natural, office professional, evening glam, weekend casual). Practice your demo presentation 5-10 times focusing on: product application techniques, shade selection guidance, look-building (starting with base → eyes → lips), pricing transparency, and easy ordering process. Create product bundles for common scenarios—"First Date Look," "Job Interview Confidence," "Mom's Night Out."</li>
          <li><strong>Week 3: Host First Practice Parties</strong> — Schedule 3-5 practice parties with friends or family (not selling yet, just testing your format). Gather feedback: Was demo length right? Were products easy to understand? Did shade recommendations work? Was pricing clear? Which looks generated the most interest? Document successful techniques and awkward moments—refine your party script accordingly. Test different party formats to find what works best for your personality—some influencers excel at high-energy Facebook lives, others prefer intimate in-home tutorials.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 4: Launch First Revenue-Generating Parties</strong> — Host 2-3 official Farmasi parties with audiences beyond close friends—coworkers, neighbors, social groups, online communities. Execute your refined demo format showing 2-3 complete looks with clear product applications. Offer party-exclusive specials or host rewards to incentivize bookings. Provide easy ordering options (app, website, order forms). Follow up within 24-48 hours with attendees—answer questions, confirm orders, offer personalized product recommendations based on their stated preferences during the party.</li>
          <li><strong>Day 30: Master the Farmasi AI Playbook</strong> — Return to this page and implement each AI tactic. Set up shade matching automation (selfie analysis for foundation recommendations), create 15-minute mini demo scripts, build product bundles organized by look, design sampling tracking systems, establish weekly party rhythm with automated invites, create referral ask timing sequences post-purchase, and package your party materials for team duplication.</li>
          <li><strong>30 Days Forward: Identify Recruiting Prospects</strong> — After hosting 5-10 successful parties and building product confidence, identify potential Beauty Influencer recruits. Look for: customers who attended multiple parties, friends asking detailed questions about your business, makeup enthusiasts with social media presence, individuals expressing interest in flexible income, party hosts who enjoyed the experience. Lead with customer experience first—let them love the products before discussing business opportunity.</li>
          <li><strong>Duplicate & Scale</strong> — Package your party demo scripts, product bundle recommendations, shade matching guides, sampling systems, party invitation templates, and post-party follow-up sequences into a turnkey system. Train new influencers on your 30-day roadmap: product testing → demo rehearsal → practice parties → revenue parties → business opportunity positioning. Goal: new influencers can host their first party within 10-14 days by duplicating your documented system.</li>
          <li><strong>Ongoing: Build Beauty Authority</strong> — Continue sharing makeup tutorials, skincare tips, and beauty education content on social media. Position yourself as a trusted beauty resource, not just a catalog salesperson. Host regular parties (weekly or biweekly rhythm), feature seasonal looks, introduce new product launches, celebrate customer transformations. Focus recruiting on customers who already love Farmasi products and demonstrate social influence—their authentic enthusiasm converts better than opportunity-focused recruiting.</li>
        </ol>
