Subject: Pricing Inquiry - Bulk Aged Leads for Software Tool Promotion

Hello,

I'm interested in purchasing MLM leads for promoting a software tool
(Team Build Pro - an AI downline builder app) to network marketing
professionals.

I have a few questions:

1. What is the pricing for your aged leads (30+ days)?
2. Do you offer email-only leads at a reduced rate?
   (We primarily need email addresses, not phone numbers)
3. Can you provide a small sample (5-10 leads) to test data quality?
4. What percentage of your leads typically have valid email addresses?
5. Are your leads CAN-SPAM compliant for cold email outreach?

Our target audience:
- Active network marketers looking for recruiting tools
- People who have expressed interest in home-based business opportunities
- US-based primarily

Budget: Looking to start with 500-1,000 leads for initial testing.

Thank you,
Stephen Scott
Team Build Pro
```
