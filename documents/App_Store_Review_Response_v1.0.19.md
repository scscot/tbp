RESOLVED ISSUES - Apple Sign-In Compatibility

Primary Issue Resolution
Problem: App exhibited "sign in with Apple temporarily disabled" error on iPad Air 5th generation running iPadOS 26.0

Root Cause Identified:
- iPadOS 26.0 is a bleeding-edge beta version with potential Apple Sign-In service inconsistencies
- Missing comprehensive error handling for "temporarily disabled" scenarios
- Lack of graceful fallback mechanisms when Apple Sign-In is unavailable

Technical Improvements Implemented

1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error handling for "temporarily disabled" scenarios in `AuthProvider.signInWithApple()`
- Implemented specific detection for service unavailability messages
- Added user-friendly error messages directing users to alternative sign-in methods

2. Improved Availability Detection
- Enhanced `_checkAppleSignInAvailability()` with beta OS compatibility
- Added proactive availability testing with timeout mechanisms
- Implemented detection for "temporarily disabled" states during availability checks
- Added comprehensive logging for troubleshooting reviewer scenarios

3. Fallback Mechanisms
- Apple Sign-In button automatically hidden when service is unavailable
- Clear user messaging when Apple Sign-In is temporarily disabled
- Prominent fallback options (Email and Google sign-in) always available
- App remains fully functional without Apple Sign-In

4. Beta OS Compatibility
- Added timeout protection for Apple Sign-In operations
- Enhanced error detection for beta OS-specific issues
- Improved logging for reviewer troubleshooting
