        <h2>What eXp Realty Offers (in plain English)</h2>
        <p>eXp Realty is a cloud-based real estate brokerage operating entirely in a virtual environment without physical office locations. Agents access training, collaboration tools, and brokerage services through eXp World, a 3D virtual campus built in a gaming-style platform. The core offering includes competitive commission splits (80/20 with cap), stock awards (EXPI shares on NASDAQ), revenue-sharing opportunities from agent sponsorship, and comprehensive training through eXp University.</p>
        <p>Unlike traditional MLM companies, eXp Realty is a licensed real estate brokerage where agents earn primarily from real estate transactions. The revenue-share component rewards agents for attracting other licensed agents to the brokerage—similar to a team override structure but grounded in real estate production. Additional offerings include kvCORE technology platform, lead generation tools, mentorship programs, and global expansion opportunities across 24+ countries.</p>
        <p class="muted">Key insight: eXp attracts agents seeking lower overhead, equity ownership, and passive income from agent attraction—not product sales.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Markets & Footprint</h3>
          <p>eXp Realty operates in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, India, Mexico, Portugal, France, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Italy, Hong Kong, Colombia, Spain, Israel, Panama, Germany, Dominican Republic, Greece, New Zealand, Chile, Poland, and Dubai. The cloud-based model enables rapid international expansion without physical office infrastructure.</p>
          <p class="muted">International reach means your agent attraction must work across real estate licensing systems and commission structures.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Distribution Model</h3>
          <p>eXp Realty uses an 80/20 commission split until agents reach a $16,000 cap annually, then 100% commission. Agents can earn revenue share (up to 5% of gross commission income) from sponsored agents across 7 tiers. Stock awards include EXPI shares for production milestones and agent attraction. Icon Agent status (20+ agent sponsors) unlocks additional equity and bonuses. Agents must maintain active real estate licenses.</p>
          <p class="muted">Key insight: Lead with education and brokerage value. Revenue-share is a bonus, not the primary pitch.</p>

        <h2>Training & Onboarding Snapshot</h2>
        <p>eXp Realty emphasizes agent education through eXp University (live classes, certifications, designation courses), eXp World campus tours, ICON Agent training, and technology onboarding for kvCORE and cloud collaboration tools. New agents receive sponsor mentorship, state-specific compliance training, and business planning workshops. The company hosts annual EXPCON conferences and regional meetups. The challenge: conveying the cloud-based model and revenue-share opportunity without appearing like an MLM recruitment scheme.</p>

        <h2>Your AI Recruiting Playbook for eXp Realty</h2>
        <ol class="checklist">
          <li><strong>Lead with agent pain points.</strong> Segment prospects into high-split seekers, tech-hungry agents, passive-income builders, equity-focused investors, or team leaders needing better splits. Your message changes by agent profile.</li>
          <li><strong>Brokerage comparison calculator.</strong> Use AI to generate personalized commission split comparisons showing net income at eXp vs. their current brokerage, including cap benefits and stock value.</li>
          <li><strong>eXp World demo walkthrough.</strong> Create repeatable virtual campus tours with AI-generated invites, reminder sequences, and post-tour follow-up questions about pain points and goals.</li>
          <li><strong>Education-first content series.</strong> Host "Real Estate Business Building" workshops (lead gen, systems, scaling) with eXp as the backend solution—not the primary topic. AI automates invites and follow-ups.</li>
          <li><strong>Icon Agent roadmap builder.</strong> For agents interested in attraction, create a 90-day roadmap to Icon Agent status with weekly AI check-ins on progress and coaching tips.</li>
          <li><strong>Objection scripts for skeptics.</strong> Pre-script responses to "is this MLM?" and "why leave my brokerage?" with brokerage license proof, NASDAQ stock charts, and licensed agent testimonials.</li>
          <li><strong>Duplicate the education system.</strong> Save your comparison calculators, demo scripts, and workshop outlines so new agents can attract others using value—not hype.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Getting Started with eXp Realty: Your First 30 Days</h2>
        <p class="muted">New to eXp Realty? Here's your step-by-step roadmap to launching your cloud-based real estate agent journey with revenue share and equity benefits:</p>
        <ol class="checklist">
          <li><strong>Day 1-3: Foundation & License Transfer Process</strong> — Complete your eXp Realty agent onboarding and initiate license transfer from your current brokerage (verify transfer timelines and any contractual obligations you have). Study the eXp compensation structure—understand the 80/20 commission split with $16,000 annual cap (you keep 100% after cap), equity rewards (EXPI stock grants for production and attraction), revenue share system (earn from agents you sponsor and their growth), and Icon Agent program (passive income from agent attraction). Navigate the eXp World virtual campus—familiarize yourself with training resources, broker support, transaction coordination, and agent collaboration tools. This cloud-based infrastructure replaces traditional brick-and-mortar office overhead.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 1: Personal Production & Split Analysis</strong> — Calculate your actual net income comparison between your previous brokerage and eXp based on your personal production levels. Example: if you closed $300,000 GCI last year at 70/30 split, you netted $210,000 minus desk fees/franchise costs. At eXp 80/20 split, you'd net $240,000 (plus stock and revenue share potential)—a $30,000 increase from split alone. Document this personal ROI analysis—it becomes your credibility foundation when discussing eXp with other agents. Focus your first week on understanding eXp's transaction support, broker accessibility, and tech tools so you can operate effectively without a physical office.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 2: eXp World Mastery & Tech Stack Integration</strong> — Spend 7 days mastering eXp World virtual campus navigation—attend live training sessions, explore collaboration spaces, practice using virtual meeting rooms, access transaction coordinators, and leverage broker support efficiently. Integrate eXp's technology stack with your existing CRM, lead generation systems, and marketing tools. Learn Skyslope for transaction management, explore kvCORE (eXp's lead generation platform), and understand eXp marketing resources. Join eXp mastermind groups and agent collaboration forums—network with top producers and learn proven systems. Your comfort with cloud-based operations becomes essential for agent attraction credibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 3: Revenue Share System Understanding</strong> — Study eXp's revenue share compensation plan thoroughly—understand how you earn from agents you personally sponsor (Tier 1), agents they sponsor (Tier 2-7), and the qualification requirements for revenue share eligibility. Learn Icon Agent qualification criteria (attracting 3 agents per month for 6 months) and passive income potential. Review official income disclosure statements to set realistic expectations. Calculate potential revenue share based on conservative agent attraction scenarios—don't lead with hype, position as supplemental income opportunity for active agents building teams. This education prepares you to discuss eXp's unique value proposition professionally.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 3-4: Identify Agent Attraction Prospects</strong> — Define your ideal eXp prospect profiles based on agent pain points. High-split seekers: agents producing $150K+ GCI frustrated with 50-70% splits eating their profits. Tech-hungry agents: younger professionals wanting cloud-based, location-independent operations. Team leaders: agents with downlines getting poor splits for team members. Equity-focused: investors understanding NASDAQ-traded stock as wealth building. List 20-30 specific agents in your network matching these profiles. Don't contact them yet—study their current brokerage situations, production levels, business models, and specific pain points eXp solves.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 4: First Value-Based Agent Conversations</strong> — Reach out to 10-15 agent prospects from your list with education-first conversations (not recruitment pitches). Offer to share brokerage comparison calculators showing their net income at eXp versus current situation based on their actual production numbers. Invite them to virtual eXp World demo tours—let them experience cloud-based operations firsthand. Share your personal eXp transition story authentically—what you were paying before, what you're netting now, technology benefits you've gained. Focus entirely on their business improvement, not your revenue share earnings. Document questions, objections, and interest signals.</li>
          <li><strong>Day 30: Master the eXp AI Playbook</strong> — Return to this page and implement each AI recruiting tactic systematically. Set up automated agent pain point segmentation, build brokerage comparison calculator tools, create eXp World demo walkthrough sequences with invites and follow-ups, develop education-first content series (real estate business building workshops), design Icon Agent roadmap builders with progress tracking, establish objection response scripts for skeptics, and package your entire education system for new agents you sponsor. The AI infrastructure handles qualification and nurturing—you focus on high-value agent conversations with pre-qualified prospects who have genuine interest in brokerage improvement.</li>
          <li><strong>30 Days Forward: Agent Attraction & Icon Agent Path</strong> — Once you have personal eXp experience, technology mastery, and revenue share system knowledge, begin systematic agent attraction. Target 3-5 new agent conversations per month with focus on quality over quantity—one productive agent who closes deals and attracts others is worth more than ten inactive license holders. Share the eXp opportunity focusing on business improvement: better splits (more net income), technology leverage (cloud-based efficiency), equity rewards (wealth building through stock), and revenue share potential (supplemental income from team building). If you're pursuing Icon Agent status (3 agents/month for 6 months), create a systematic attraction system you can sustain long-term—education content, brokerage comparison tools, demo tours, value-first conversations.</li>
          <li><strong>Duplicate & Scale</strong> — Package your brokerage comparison calculator templates, eXp World demo tour scripts, agent pain point qualification process, value-based conversation frameworks, objection handling responses, license transfer checklists, and revenue share education materials into a turnkey system for agents you sponsor. Train new agents on the same 30-day roadmap you followed—personal production focus → technology mastery → revenue share education → prospect identification → value-based conversations → agent sponsorship → Icon Agent pursuit. The goal: every new agent focuses on their personal production first, then builds attraction systems through documented value delivery, not recruitment hype.</li>
          <li><strong>Ongoing: Production First, Attraction Second</strong> — Maintain credibility by prioritizing your personal real estate production—close deals, serve clients exceptionally, build your business. Agent attraction works best when you're a producing agent sharing genuine business improvements, not a recruiter who stopped selling real estate. Continue sharing eXp split advantages, technology benefits, and equity rewards with agents who demonstrate genuine interest in brokerage improvement. Focus on licensed, active agents producing $100K+ GCI—they're more likely to appreciate eXp's value proposition than brand-new licensees. Your recruiting power comes from documented production success and authentic business improvement testimonials, not MLM-style opportunity pitching.</li>

        <p><strong>Compliance note:</strong> eXp Realty is a licensed real estate brokerage, not an MLM company. All agents must hold active real estate licenses. Revenue-share is tied to agent production and licensing requirements. Avoid income guarantees; focus on brokerage value, commission structures, and equity opportunities. Follow NAR guidelines and state real estate regulations.</p>
        <p>When in doubt, lead with education and brokerage comparison—let agents make informed business decisions based on their production numbers.</p>
