## 📋 Prompt to Use:

```
Please learn everything about Team Build Pro by:

1. Reading the comprehensive knowledge base at /Users/sscott/tbp/TEAM_BUILD_PRO_KNOWLEDGE.md
2. Reading the development guide at /Users/sscott/tbp/CLAUDE.md

Key things to internalize:

- 16 pre-written messages (8 for prospects + 8 for partners) + 24/7 AI Coach
- 75% of recruits quit in first year (the problem we solve)
- Dynamic FAQ with ?new= parameter for prospect vs professional views
- Firebase UID-based architecture (never mix with UUIDs)
- Professional tone, no emojis unless requested
- Current working directory: /Users/sscott/tbp/

After reviewing, confirm your understanding and ask what I need help with today.
