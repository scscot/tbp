GIVE YOUR TEAM THE AI RECRUITING ADVANTAGE

Team Build Pro is the AI-powered downline building system for direct sales professionals. Use it to coach your prospects, empower your existing team, and scale duplication across your entire organization.

Your prospects pre-build their teams before joining YOUR business. Your existing partners get the same AI tools you use. Everyone grows faster. No awkward pitches. No expensive funnels. Just AI-powered tools that work.

THE COLD START PROBLEM (SOLVED)

75% of recruits quit in their first year because starting from zero is brutal. Team Build Pro eliminates this:

Your recruiting prospects build their teams BEFORE joining your business—so they launch Day 1 with momentum, not from zero. When they finally join YOUR opportunity, they bring established teams and proven skills.

HOW IT WORKS

FOR YOUR RECRUITING PROSPECTS:

They build and prove themselves BEFORE committing to your business:

 1. You share your personalized Team Build Pro referral link
 2. They invite contacts and build their network risk-free
 3. AI coaches them through every step (messages, follow-ups, tracking)
 4. Work 15 minutes at a time—during lunch, coffee breaks, or evening downtime
 5. They hit qualification milestones (4 direct + 20 total team)
 6. They receive invitation to join YOUR business—with their team ready

When they join your opportunity? They bring pre-built teams, proven skills, and real momentum.

FOR YOUR EXISTING TEAM:
