        <h2>What Young Living Sells (in plain English)</h2>
        <p>Young Living is the world's leading essential oils company, offering pure therapeutic-grade oils and oil-infused products. The flagship product line includes single oils (Lavender, Peppermint, Frankincense) and proprietary blends like Thieves®, PanAway®, and Stress Away™. Beyond oils, Young Living has expanded into personal care (Savvy Minerals makeup), supplements (NingXia Red antioxidant), home cleaning products, and even pet care.</p>
        <p class="muted">The "Seed to Seal" quality commitment is central to the brand story—covering sourcing, science, and standards from farm to bottle.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Markets & Footprint</h3>
          <p>Young Living operates globally with company-owned farms in Utah, Idaho, Ecuador, France, Croatia, and partner farms worldwide. The company serves members in North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East—spanning over 100 countries.</p>
          <p class="muted">International reach means your system must work across languages, cultures, and time zones.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Distribution Model</h3>
          <p>Young Living uses a unilevel compensation plan with 12 levels of depth. Brand Partners earn through retail sales, commissions on team volume, and bonuses including Fast Start, Rising Star, and Generation Leadership pools. Ranks progress from Star to Royal Crown Diamond.</p>
          <p class="muted">Key insight: Duplication beats charisma. Simple systems and repeatable workflows win in essential oils.</p>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <section>
        <h2>Training & Onboarding Snapshot</h2>
        <p>Young Living emphasizes product education through classes, sampling, and farm experiences. New Brand Partners are encouraged to share Seed to Seal stories, host "make and take" workshops, and build through the "Share, Enroll, Teach" model. Corporate training includes online resources, regional events, and the annual Grand Convention. The challenge: most training focuses on product passion, not systematic follow-up.</p>

        <h2>Your AI Recruiting Playbook for Young Living</h2>
        <ol class="checklist">
          <li><strong>Lead with lifestyle lanes.</strong> Segment prospects into wellness (sleep, stress), fitness (recovery, energy), beauty (skincare, clean makeup), home (toxin-free cleaning), or business builder. Your message changes by lane.</li>
          <li><strong>Farm-to-home storytelling.</strong> Tie specific oils to Seed to Seal farms. Example: "Our Lavender comes from a family farm in Provence—here's a 90-second video."</li>
          <li><strong>Class rhythm over one-off posts.</strong> Repeatable 45-minute virtual classes (intro to oils, Thieves for immune support, beauty basics) with AI-generated invites and follow-ups.</li>
          <li><strong>Sample tracker system.</strong> When someone gets a sample, AI prompts check-ins on day 3, 7, and 14 with use tips and reorder invitations.</li>
          <li><strong>Results journal prompts.</strong> Ask for daily feedback (energy, sleep, mood) but keep claims compliant—focus on experience, not medical promises.</li>
          <li><strong>Objection scripts ready.</strong> Automate responses for: price ("cost per use"), MLM concerns ("tool for your existing customers"), quality questions ("link to Seed to Seal page").</li>
          <li><strong>Duplicate the entire flow.</strong> Save your class deck, sample follow-up sequence, and FAQ responses so new partners copy it on day one.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Getting Started with Young Living: Your First 30 Days</h2>
        <p class="muted">New to Young Living? Here's your step-by-step roadmap to launching your Brand Partner journey with momentum:</p>
        <ol class="checklist">
          <li><strong>Day 1-3: Foundation Setup</strong> — Complete your Brand Partner enrollment, order your Premium Starter Kit (typically includes 12 essential oils + diffuser), and enroll in Essential Rewards for monthly ordering benefits and product credits.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 1: Personal Oil Experience</strong> — Use a different oil daily from your starter kit. Try Lavender for sleep, Peppermint for focus and headaches, Thieves for immune support, and Stress Away for calming. Document your experiences in a journal for authentic sharing.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 1: Seed to Seal Education</strong> — Study Young Living's Seed to Seal quality commitment, watch farm videos (Lavender in Provence, Peppermint in Mona, Frankincense in Oman), and learn the brand story to share with confidence.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 2: Warm Market Outreach</strong> — Create your contact list of 50-100 people and segment by need: wellness seekers (immune support, sleep), parents (toxin-free home, kids' wellness), fitness enthusiasts (recovery, energy), or business builders. Reach out to 20 people.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 2: Team Build Pro Setup</strong> — Download Team Build Pro to organize your prospect pipeline, track who's interested in oils vs business, and let qualified prospects start pre-building their teams before officially enrolling.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 3: First Oil Class</strong> — Host your first intro to oils class (virtual or in-person) for 8-12 people. Present the starter kit oils, demo diffusion and topical application (proper dilution), share your personal experiences, and offer sample vials.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 3-4: Sample Follow-Up</strong> — Send oil samples to 10-15 prospects with usage instructions. Follow up on day 3, 7, and 14 to ask about experiences, answer questions, and guide them toward Premium Starter Kits or Essential Rewards enrollment.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 4: First Enrollments</strong> — Convert 3-5 people to Brand Partners with Premium Starter Kits and Essential Rewards. Focus on those who loved their samples and expressed interest in sharing oils with their own networks.</li>
          <li><strong>First 30 Days: Class Duplication</strong> — Package your entire intro class—slide deck, sample kit list, follow-up message templates, objection responses, Seed to Seal stories—so new Brand Partners can host their first class within 7 days.</li>
          <li><strong>Ongoing: Essential Rewards Momentum</strong> — Use Team Build Pro to track your team's Essential Rewards enrollments and monthly ordering, maintain communication across your organization, and identify leaders ready for rank advancement.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Young Living Brand Partners who host 2+ oil classes and enroll 4-6 people on Essential Rewards in their first 30 days are 5x more likely to reach Star rank within 90 days. Team Build Pro helps you systematize and scale your class model.</p>
