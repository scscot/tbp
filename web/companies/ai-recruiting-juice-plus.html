        <h2>What Juice Plus Sells (in plain English)</h2>
        <p>Juice Plus is a whole-food based nutritional supplement company founded in 1970 and headquartered in Collierville, Tennessee. The flagship products are juice powder concentrate capsules derived from 30+ fruits, vegetables, and berries. The three core blends are Orchard Blend (apple, peach, cranberry, orange, mango, cherry, papaya), Garden Blend (broccoli, kale, cabbage, parsley, tomato, beet, spinach), and Vineyard Blend (grapes, blueberries, raspberries, cranberries, blackberries). Beyond capsules, the product line includes Complete Shakes (plant-based protein with added nutrition), Perform protein bars, and Juice Plus Chewables for children. The Tower Garden aeroponic growing system represents a unique home gardening offering tied to the nutrition message.</p>
        <p class="muted">Juice Plus positions itself as nutrition insurance for families struggling to eat the recommended servings of produce daily—backed by 40+ peer-reviewed clinical studies on ingredient bioavailability.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Who Buys Juice Plus</h3>
          <p>Juice Plus attracts health-conscious families, busy professionals seeking convenient nutrition, parents concerned about children's vegetable intake, and fitness enthusiasts looking for plant-based recovery support. The customer base skews toward mothers aged 30-50 who prioritize wellness but lack time for meal prep. The business opportunity appeals to former teachers, nurses, wellness coaches, and stay-at-home parents seeking flexible income without inventory management. The Healthy Starts for Families program offering free products for children creates strong retention and referral momentum.</p>
          <p class="muted">Strong presence in North America and Europe with growing markets in Asia and Australia.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>How Juice Plus Distributes</h3>
          <p>Juice Plus operates a unilevel compensation plan with seven levels of depth plus generational backend bonuses. Partners earn retail commissions up to 6% on personal sales after hitting volume targets, plus network marketing commissions starting at 90 PV monthly qualification. Residual commissions are paid through the unilevel structure based on team volume. Ranks include Partner, Senior Partner, Sales Coordinator, through National Marketing Director. The $50 enrollment fee keeps barrier to entry low. Unique advantage: the Healthy Starts program gives free children's products when adults order, creating built-in referral mechanisms and family retention.</p>
          <p class="muted">Key insight: Clinical research backing makes credibility easier than most nutrition MLMs—lean into the science, not hype.</p>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <section>
        <h2>Training & Onboarding Snapshot</h2>
        <p>Juice Plus emphasizes personal experience and clinical research in training. New partners are encouraged to use products for 90 days before recruiting, attend virtual training sessions, and leverage corporate-provided study summaries. The company provides scripts for health screening questionnaires and follow-up protocols. However, traditional training relies heavily on home parties, wellness presentations, and one-on-one meetings—leaving systematic digital prospecting and automated follow-up largely unaddressed. Most partners struggle with consistent lead generation and duplicating their approach across a geographically dispersed team.</p>

        <ol class="checklist" id="getting-started-list">
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Research-first prospecting.</strong> Lead with clinical studies, not testimonials. Create a 2-minute video summarizing the 40+ peer-reviewed studies on bioavailability. Use this as a qualifier—people who watch it are serious, people who skip it aren't your audience.</li>
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Picky eater parent targeting.</strong> Build social ads and content specifically for parents of toddlers and young children who won't eat vegetables. Emphasize the Healthy Starts for Families program where kids get free Chewables when adults order—this is your strongest retention hook.</li>
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>90-day transformation tracker.</strong> Create AI-triggered check-ins at day 7, 14, 30, 60, and 90 for new customers. Ask about energy, skin, digestion, and overall wellness using standardized questions. Collect compliant testimonials and transition high-responders into partner conversations around day 60.</li>
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Tower Garden cross-sell automation.</strong> After 4 months on capsules, trigger an automated sequence introducing Tower Garden for customers showing high engagement. Position it as "grow what you're supplementing"—a natural upsell that deepens product philosophy buy-in.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Objection database with AI retrieval.</strong> Build searchable responses for common pushback: "just eat real food" (convenience + bioavailability studies), "too expensive" (cost per serving breakdown vs. organic produce), "MLM concerns" (point to clinical research and ingredient transparency vs. typical supplement industry).</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Children's wellness content engine.</strong> Create shareable graphics and short videos on kids' nutrition challenges—picky eating, school lunch concerns, immune support during flu season. Position Chewables as the solution. Automate posting across your team's social channels for consistent brand presence.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Healthy Starts referral prompts.</strong> Build AI reminders for partners to check in with customers approaching their child's next birthday or school year start. "Does your child's friend struggle with vegetables too?" campaigns create natural expansion through existing families.</li>

        <h2>Getting Started with Juice Plus: Your First 30 Days</h2>
        <p class="muted">New to Juice Plus? Here's your step-by-step roadmap to launching your Partner journey with whole-food nutrition and clinical research backing:</p>
        <ol class="checklist" id="getting-started-list">
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Day 1-3: Foundation Setup</strong> — Complete your Juice Plus Partner enrollment ($50 fee), order your personal product pack (Orchard, Garden, and Vineyard capsules for comprehensive fruit/vegetable nutrition, or Complete Shakes if that's your focus), and set up your replicated website. Study the unilevel compensation plan—understand 90 PV monthly qualification, retail commissions (up to 6%), unilevel bonuses through 7 levels, and rank progression from Partner through National Marketing Director.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 1: Personal 90-Day Experience</strong> — Begin your own 90-day Juice Plus journey. Take the capsules daily as directed (Orchard and Garden in morning, Vineyard at dinner). Document your energy levels, skin quality, digestion, immune resilience, and overall wellness after 7 days. If you have children, enroll them in the free Healthy Starts for Families program (free Chewables when you order). Your personal and family experience becomes your strongest recruiting tool.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 1: Clinical Research Education</strong> — Study Juice Plus's 40+ peer-reviewed clinical studies—bioavailability research, antioxidant levels, cardiovascular health markers, skin density improvements, and immune function support. Learn how whole-food concentrate differs from synthetic vitamins, the "nutrition insurance" positioning for busy families, and Tower Garden's connection to the grow-your-own-food philosophy. Master the research-backed story for health-conscious, science-minded prospects.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 2: Warm Market Outreach</strong> — Create your contact list of 50-100 people. Segment by concern: parents with picky eaters (Healthy Starts program), busy professionals (convenience nutrition), fitness enthusiasts (plant-based recovery), wellness seekers (preventive health), and business opportunity prospects. Share your personal Week 1 experience with category-appropriate contacts. Lead with clinical research credibility, not hype.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 2: Team Build Pro Setup</strong> — Download Team Build Pro to organize your prospect pipeline by interest category (parents, professionals, fitness, wellness, business), track who's engaged with your research content, and let qualified prospects start building their own teams before officially joining, so they launch with pre-built momentum.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 3: First Nutrition Consultations</strong> — Conduct 10-15 wellness consultations (virtual or in-person). Use health screening questionnaires to identify nutrition gaps. Share the "nutrition insurance" concept for families not eating 7-13 servings of produce daily. For parents, emphasize the Healthy Starts program—free kids' Chewables create family retention. Offer 90-day transformation tracking (Days 7/30/60/90 check-ins). Share clinical study summaries for credibility.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 3-4: First Customers & Healthy Starts Enrollment</strong> — Convert 5-10 consultation prospects to customers with monthly auto-ship orders. Focus on the Orchard + Garden + Vineyard combo (complete nutrition spectrum) and families with Healthy Starts enrollment (kids get free Chewables, parents reorder consistently for family benefit). Track 90 PV qualification and early wellness feedback. Use Day 30 customer check-ins to gather compliant testimonials.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 4: First Partners</strong> — Identify 2-3 serious business builders—people experiencing personal wellness improvements, understanding the clinical research advantage, and having strong networks of parents, health professionals, or wellness communities. Walk them through Partner enrollment. Help them order their product pack and plan their first 10 wellness consultations for Week 5. Share your health screening questionnaire and clinical study resources.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>First 30 Days: Research-Based Playbook Duplication</strong> — Package your entire system—health screening questionnaire templates, clinical study summary library (2-minute video + study links), 90-day transformation tracker (Day 7/30/60/90 check-ins), Healthy Starts enrollment scripts for parents, objection responses with research citations, cost-per-serving breakdown vs. organic produce, and Tower Garden cross-sell sequence—into a simple playbook your new Partners can use to start consultations in 48 hours.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Ongoing: Clinical Credibility Team Growth</strong> — Use Team Build Pro to track your organization's 90 PV compliance, identify Partners hitting rank milestones, maintain consistent communication across your team, and share the 40+ clinical studies that create scientific credibility. Juice Plus's research backing differentiates you from supplement MLMs lacking peer-reviewed evidence—emphasize science over hype.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> New Juice Plus Partners who complete their personal 90-day experience, convert 5+ families with Healthy Starts enrollment, and master clinical research positioning within 60 days build teams with 4x higher retention. Team Build Pro helps you track 90 PV qualification, organize wellness consultations, and duplicate your research-based system as your team grows globally.</p>

            <h3>Parent of young children</h3>
            <p>"Does your kid actually eat the recommended 7-13 servings of fruits and veggies daily? Ours don't either. I have a 3-minute video explaining how we bridge that gap with Juice Plus Chewables—and they're free with adult orders. Want it?"</p>

            <h3>Business builder (skeptic-friendly)</h3>
            <p>"This isn't typical MLM nutrition—Juice Plus has 40+ peer-reviewed studies on bioavailability. The business model is simple: help families get better nutrition. If I share a no-hype overview (one PDF), would you look at it?"</p>

        <p><strong>Compliance note:</strong> Juice Plus policies prohibit medical claims, disease treatment claims, and unapproved income representations. Focus on whole-food nutrition, published clinical research, and general wellness experiences. Use official product pages and approved marketing materials. When discussing business opportunity, always include income disclosure statement and clarify that success requires consistent effort over time. Never claim products cure or prevent disease.</p>
        <p>When in doubt, let the system do the heavy lifting—consistent check-ins, research-based education sequences, and automated referral prompts work better than exaggerated claims or pressure tactics.</p>
