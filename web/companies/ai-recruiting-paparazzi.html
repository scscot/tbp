        <h2>What Paparazzi Sells (in plain English)</h2>
        <p>Paparazzi Accessories sells trendy jewelry and fashion accessories at the disruptive price point of just $5 per piece. The product line includes necklaces, earrings, bracelets, rings, hair accessories, lanyards, and men's accessories—all priced affordably to make fashion accessible to everyone. Founded by sisters Misty and Chani and their husbands Ryan and Trent, Paparazzi's mission is to bring strength, independence, and empowerment to individuals and families by building confidence and financial freedom through affordable fashion. Consultants purchase inventory at wholesale for $2.75 per piece plus tax and sell at the $5 retail price, earning 45% commission on every sale. The low price point removes buyer resistance and makes impulse purchases easy.</p>
        <p class="muted">The $5 positioning is Paparazzi's superpower—customers can afford to buy multiple pieces without guilt, creating high-volume sales opportunities at parties, events, and online.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Who Buys Paparazzi</h3>
          <p>Paparazzi customers are fashion-conscious women seeking affordable accessories to complement their wardrobes, moms buying jewelry for themselves and daughters, teens wanting trendy styles without breaking budgets, and gift shoppers who can afford to buy multiples. The business opportunity attracts stay-at-home moms seeking flexible income, fashion enthusiasts wanting to turn passion into profit, social sellers comfortable with parties and online engagement, and aspiring entrepreneurs looking for low-barrier entry into direct sales. The $5 price point creates instant conversation starters and removes the awkwardness of high-pressure sales tactics.</p>
          <p class="muted">Low investment, high volume, simple math—customers buy 5-10 pieces per transaction, and consultants can recoup startup costs in just a few parties.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>How Paparazzi Distributes</h3>
          <p>Paparazzi provides consultants with access to wholesale jewelry ordering, personal e-commerce websites, marketing materials, and a multi-level compensation plan that rewards both sales and team building. All consultants earn the same 45% commission regardless of rank—pure simplicity. The company requires 100 pieces per rolling calendar year to maintain consultant status, with no monthly quotas. To be considered active for team commissions, consultants must order 25 pieces monthly if they have a downline. Training emphasizes party hosting, social selling strategies, inventory management, styling tips, and creating fun customer experiences.</p>
          <p class="muted">Key insight: Paparazzi's inventory model means consultants physically stock and ship products—this creates cash flow but requires inventory investment and fulfillment logistics that differ from pure drop-ship models.</p>

        <h2>Training & Onboarding Snapshot</h2>
        <p>Paparazzi training focuses on hosting engaging jewelry parties, styling pieces for maximum appeal, creating social media content that drives sales, managing inventory efficiently, and building repeat customer relationships. Corporate provides online training portals, styling guides, party game ideas, and annual conventions. The challenge: traditional Paparazzi success relies heavily on in-person parties and live social media selling—automating lead nurture, systematizing recruiting conversations, and creating digital duplication systems require strategic content planning and AI-powered follow-up sequences.</p>

        <p><strong>Compliance note:</strong> Stay within Paparazzi's policies and your local regulations. Avoid income guarantees—actual earnings vary widely based on effort, market, and sales volume. Emphasize that consultants earn from jewelry sales and that team commissions require active status with monthly purchases. Be transparent about inventory investment requirements and the physical product fulfillment model.</p>
        <p>When in doubt, let the system do the heavy lifting—consistent party invitations, styling content, and customer conversion funnels work better than hype.</p>
