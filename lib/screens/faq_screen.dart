    question: 'What exactly is Team Build Pro?',
    answer: 'Team Build Pro is a professional software tool designed to help direct sales professionals build, manage, and track their teams before and during their business journey. It\'s NOT a business opportunity or MLM company - it\'s the tool that helps you succeed in whatever opportunity you choose.',
  ),
  FAQItem(
    question: 'How is this different from other team building apps or CRM systems?',
    answer: 'Unlike generic CRMs, Team Build Pro is specifically designed for the direct sales industry. It understands the unique challenges you face: starting from zero, building momentum, qualifying prospects, and maintaining team motivation. Our system lets you pre-build your team before you even join an opportunity, giving you a massive head start.',
  ),
  FAQItem(
    question: 'Can I really build a team BEFORE joining a business opportunity?',
    answer: 'Absolutely! This is our core innovation. You can invite prospects and existing team members to Team Build Pro, let them experience team building success, and when they hit qualification milestones (4 direct sponsors + 20 total team members), they automatically get invited to join your business opportunity. It eliminates the "cold start" problem that kills most new distributors.',
  ),
  FAQItem(
    question: 'Do I need a credit card to try it?',
    answer: 'No. You get full access to all premium features for 30 days completely free, with no credit card required. You can decide to subscribe at any point during or after your trial.',

  FAQItem(
    question: 'Is Team Build Pro an MLM or business opportunity?',
    answer: 'No. Team Build Pro is not a business opportunity, MLM, or income platform of any kind. We are a software tool designed exclusively to help professionals build and track their teams. We do not provide any form of user compensation. You pay us a monthly software fee - we don\'t pay you anything.',
  ),
  FAQItem(
    question: 'How do you make money if you\'re not an MLM?',
    answer: 'We operate on a simple Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. Users pay \$4.99/month for access to our professional team building platform. That\'s it. No complicated compensation plans, no recruitment requirements, no income claims.',
  ),
  FAQItem(
    question: 'Can I use this with any direct sales company?',
    answer: 'Yes! Team Build Pro is company-agnostic. Whether you\'re in health and wellness, financial services, beauty, technology, or any other direct sales industry, our tools work with your business. You simply customize your profile with your opportunity details.',
  ),
  FAQItem(
    question: 'What if I\'m not currently with a company but want to join one?',
    answer: 'Perfect! This is where Team Build Pro shines. You can start building your team immediately, even before you\'ve chosen which company to join. When you do decide, you\'ll launch with a pre-built, motivated team instead of starting from zero.',

  FAQItem(
    question: 'How does the qualification system work?',
    answer: 'When someone joins Team Build Pro through your referral, they begin building their own team. Once they reach our success milestones (4 direct sponsors + 20 total team members), they automatically receive an invitation to join your business opportunity. This ensures only motivated, proven team builders advance to your actual business.',
  ),
  FAQItem(
    question: 'What happens if someone joins my Team Build Pro team but doesn\'t want to join my business opportunity?',
    answer: 'That\'s perfectly fine! They can continue using Team Build Pro to build their own team for whatever opportunity they choose, or they can stay focused on team building. There\'s no pressure. The beauty is that you\'re only working with people who have demonstrated commitment and success.',
  ),

    question: 'What\'s the difference between "sponsors" and "team members"?',

  ),
  FAQItem(
    question: 'Can my team members message each other?',
    answer: 'Yes! Team Build Pro includes secure, encrypted messaging so your team can communicate, share tips, and support each other.',
  ),
  FAQItem(
    question: 'What if someone in my team becomes qualified before me?',
    answer: 'That\'s actually great! It shows the system is working. They can advance to your business opportunity independently, and you continue building your own qualification. Success breeds success - having qualified team members often motivates others.',
  ),
  FAQItem(
    question: 'How do I know if my team members are active?',
    answer: 'Our dashboard shows activity levels, last login dates, team building progress, and engagement metrics for each member. You can easily identify who might need encouragement or support.',

  FAQItem(
    question: 'Can I remove someone from my team?',

  FAQItem(
    question: 'Who can see my team information?',

  FAQItem(
    question: 'Is \$4.99/month worth it compared to free alternatives?',
    answer: 'Free tools aren\'t built for the direct sales industry and lack crucial features like qualification tracking, business opportunity integration, and team analytics. For less than the cost of a coffee, you get professional-grade team building tools that can transform your business.',
  ),
  FAQItem(
    question: 'Can I write this off as a business expense?',
    answer: 'Many direct sales professionals do treat it as a business tool expense, but consult your tax advisor for guidance specific to your situation.',
  ),
  FAQItem(
    question: 'What if I need to cancel?',
    answer: 'You can cancel anytime with no cancellation fees or long-term commitments. You retain access until the end of your current billing period.',

  FAQItem(
    question: 'Isn\'t this just making direct sales more complicated?',

  ),
  FAQItem(
    question: 'What if people think this is "another MLM thing"?',
    answer: 'That\'s why we\'re very clear that Team Build Pro is software, not an opportunity. You\'re inviting people to use a professional tool, not join a business. Many people are more open to trying an app than joining an MLM.',
  ),
  FAQItem(
    question: 'How do I explain this to prospects without confusing them?',
    answer: 'Simple: "It\'s like LinkedIn for direct sales professionals. You build connections, track your team growth, and when you\'re ready to advance your career, opportunities become available." Focus on the professional development angle.',
  ),
  FAQItem(
    question: 'What if my current company doesn\'t allow outside tools?',

final List<FAQItem> _successFAQs = [
  FAQItem(
    question: 'How long does it take to see results?',
    answer: 'Direct sales success takes time regardless of tools. However, Team Build Pro users often see team growth within weeks because they\'re focused on relationship building rather than selling. The key is consistent daily activity.',
  ),
  FAQItem(
    question: 'What\'s a realistic timeline to build a qualified team?',
    answer: 'This varies greatly by individual effort and market, but our most successful users achieve qualification (4 direct, 20 total) within a few weeks of consistent activity. Remember, you\'re building relationships, not just collecting sign-ups.',
