        <h2>What ACN Sells (in plain English)</h2>
        <p>ACN is the world's largest direct seller of telecommunications, energy, and essential services that people use every day. Operating in 25 countries across four continents, ACN provides residential and business services including wireless phone plans, high-speed internet, natural gas and electricity, home security and automation, merchant services, and television packages. Unlike traditional network marketing companies selling consumable products, ACN focuses on switching customers to services they're already using—positioning IBOs as consultants helping people save money or get better service. ACN holds A+ accreditation from the Better Business Bureau and is a proud member of the Direct Selling Association, recognized for promoting ethical industry standards.</p>
        <p class="muted">The essential services angle is ACN's competitive edge—you're not asking people to buy something new, you're helping them switch providers for services they already pay for monthly, creating true residual income streams.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Who Buys ACN Services</h3>
          <p>ACN customers are everyday consumers and small business owners who want competitive rates on telecommunications and energy services. The appeal is simple: switch to ACN's partner providers and potentially save money while receiving the same or better service. The business opportunity attracts entrepreneurs seeking residual income from customer service bills, retirees wanting passive income streams, and professionals who understand subscription economics. Because everyone uses phones, internet, and utilities, the target market is essentially universal—making conversation starters easy but requiring strong positioning to differentiate from direct provider marketing.</p>
          <p class="muted">The residual income model is powerful—customers stay on service for years, and you earn monthly commissions as long as they remain active, creating true passive income potential.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>How ACN Distributes</h3>
          <p>ACN provides Independent Business Owners with marketing tools, service comparison calculators, enrollment systems, and a compensation plan that pays residual commissions month after month for as long as customers stay on service. IBOs earn from personal customer acquisition and from building teams that acquire customers. The direct selling model bypasses traditional advertising costs, allowing ACN to offer competitive rates while compensating IBOs. Training covers service positioning, switching process facilitation, objection handling, and team building systems. ACN emphasizes compliance and ethical selling practices aligned with DSA Code of Ethics standards.</p>
          <p class="muted">Key insight: ACN's 25-country footprint means proven infrastructure and regulatory compliance—your job is customer acquisition and team duplication, not service delivery or regulatory headaches.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Training & Onboarding Snapshot</h2>
        <p>ACN training focuses on the essential services value proposition, residual income modeling, service comparison presentations, switching process simplification, and business opportunity overviews. Corporate provides online training platforms, regional business presentations, annual international events, and leadership development programs. The challenge: traditional ACN recruiting relies heavily on home meetings, business briefings, and one-on-one service comparisons—digital nurture sequences, automated follow-up funnels, and AI-powered prospect qualification are typically underdeveloped in most IBOs' systems.</p>

        <h2>Getting Started with ACN: Your First 30 Days</h2>
        <p class="muted">New to ACN? Here's your step-by-step roadmap to launching your Independent Business Owner journey with essential services and residual income:</p>
        <ol class="checklist" id="getting-started-list">
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Day 1-3: Foundation Setup</strong> — Complete your ACN IBO enrollment, review the compensation plan (understand customer acquisition bonuses, residual monthly commissions, team building overrides, and rank progression from IBO to Senior Vice President), and set up your ACN replicated website with service comparison tools. Study ACN's 25-country footprint, A+ BBB rating, DSA membership, and essential services portfolio—wireless, internet, energy, home security, merchant services.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 1: Personal Service Experience</strong> — Switch at least one of your own services to ACN (wireless phone plan, internet, or energy if available in your area) to experience the process personally. Document your switching experience—ease of signup, service quality, customer support, billing clarity after 7 days. Your personal customer journey becomes your recruiting asset—"I switched my wireless to ACN last week and here's what the process was like."</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 1: Essential Services & Residual Income Education</strong> — Study ACN's value proposition: people already pay for wireless, internet, and energy monthly—you're helping them switch providers for better rates or service, earning residual commissions for as long as they stay on service. Learn service comparison positioning, switching process facilitation, regulatory compliance (ACN handles provider relationships and regulations), and residual income modeling. Master the essential services pitch—you're a consultant helping people save money on bills they already pay.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 2: Warm Market Outreach</strong> — Create your contact list of 50-100 people. Segment by service need: high wireless bills (competitive rate positioning), slow/expensive internet (faster speeds or savings angle), high energy bills (deregulated energy markets), home security needs, small business owners (merchant services), and business opportunity seekers interested in residual income. Share your personal Week 1 service switching experience with appropriate contacts. Lead with service audit and savings analysis, not business opportunity.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 2: Team Build Pro Setup</strong> — Download Team Build Pro to organize your prospect pipeline by service category (wireless, internet, energy, security, business opportunity), track who's engaged with your service comparison content and savings calculators, and let qualified prospects start building their own teams before officially joining, so they launch with pre-built customer momentum.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 3: First Service Audits & Comparisons</strong> — Conduct 10-15 service audits (virtual bill reviews, coffee service comparisons, small group presentations). Request current service bills, use ACN comparison tools to calculate potential savings, explain switching process simplicity. Offer 30-day satisfaction monitoring—check in after they switch to ensure service quality. Position yourself as consultant helping them optimize bills, not just salesperson. Emphasize ACN's A+ BBB rating and 25-country infrastructure for credibility.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 3-4: First Customers & Monthly Residual Setup</strong> — Convert 5-10 audit prospects to ACN customers (focus on wireless and internet as most universal services). Complete switching paperwork, facilitate account setup, provide customer support resources. Set up 7-day and 30-day check-in sequences to ensure satisfaction. Track customer retention—residual income depends on customers staying on service long-term. Use satisfied customer referrals to recruit next wave—happy customers become business builders.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 4: First IBOs (Customer-First Positioning)</strong> — Identify 2-3 serious business builders—people who switched as customers first, experienced good service quality, understand residual income model, and having networks in consumer or small business communities. Walk them through IBO enrollment. Help them switch their own services and plan their first 10 service audits for Week 5. Share your bill audit templates, service comparison scripts, and switching facilitation checklists.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>First 30 Days: Service Audit Playbook Duplication</strong> — Package your entire system—service audit questionnaire, bill analysis templates, ACN comparison calculator walkthrough, switching process checklist, 30-day customer satisfaction follow-up sequences, residual income modeling spreadsheet, business overview presentation, and compliance-approved service claims—into a playbook your new IBOs can use to start customer acquisition in 48 hours.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Ongoing: Residual Income-Based Team Growth</strong> — Use Team Build Pro to track your organization's customer retention rates (key metric for residual income), identify IBOs hitting qualification milestones, maintain consistent communication across your team (potentially across 25 countries), and share the essential services positioning that creates sustainable residual income. Focus on customer-first approach—people become customers, experience service quality, then explore business opportunity with credibility already established. ACN's 25-country compliance infrastructure and A+ BBB rating provide stability and trust.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> New ACN IBOs who switch their own services first, acquire 5+ satisfied customers with strong retention, and master service audit positioning within 60 days build teams with 4x higher retention. Team Build Pro helps you track service audits, organize by service category, and duplicate your customer-first system as your team grows across ACN's global footprint.</p>

        <p><strong>Compliance note:</strong> Stay within <a href="https://acn.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACN</a>'s policies and your local regulations. Avoid income guarantees—use official income disclosure statements when discussing earnings. Emphasize that residual income depends on customer retention and service quality. Be transparent about startup costs and ongoing requirements. Only make service claims that can be verified with official ACN provider comparisons.</p>
        <p>When in doubt, let the system do the heavy lifting—consistent service audits, savings projections, and customer-first positioning work better than hype.</p>
