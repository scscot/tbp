## Full Script

```
The person who sent you here isn't just inviting you to join a business. They're giving you something most new recruits never get — a way to see if this will actually work, before you commit.

Most people who join direct sales start from zero — no team, no momentum, just a list of people to call and no idea what to say. That's the hard way.

Team Build Pro is the smart way. It's an AI-powered app that lets you start building your team right now — before you've invested anything.

You get 16 pre-written messages for every situation. An AI Coach answers your questions 24/7. And you see real progress before you make any decision.

Instead of taking a leap of faith, you test-drive success.

## Production Notes

1. **Tone:** Warm, welcoming, encouraging — they were invited by someone who believes in them
2. **Emphasis Words:** "something most new recruits never get", "BEFORE you commit", "the smart way", "test-drive success"
3. **Key Difference from Professionals Video:** Acknowledges the referral context; focuses on opportunity, not statistics
4. **Avatar Expression:** Start warm and welcoming (acknowledging referrer), confident in middle (presenting solution), encouraging at close (invitation)
5. **No Image Overlays:** Video embeds on website where app screenshots are already visible
6. **Opening:** Honors the referrer's intent — positions them as someone who cares about the prospect's success
