        <h2>What iGenius Global Sells (in plain English)</h2>
        <p>iGenius Global is a fintech-focused direct sales company offering financial education platforms, AI-powered trading tools, and community-based wealth building systems. The core offering includes subscription access to financial literacy courses, market analysis software, algorithmic trading assistance, and investment education across stocks, forex, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. iGenius combines educational content with technology tools designed to democratize trading knowledge previously available only to institutional investors. The business model allows affiliates to earn commissions by sharing platform subscriptions and building teams of financially curious individuals seeking trading education and income opportunity. Operating internationally, iGenius positions itself at the intersection of network marketing, fintech innovation, and financial independence movements.</p>
        <p class="muted">The education-first positioning is iGenius Global's competitive edge—you're not selling get-rich-quick trading schemes, you're offering structured financial literacy and technology tools for informed decision-making.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Who Joins iGenius Global</h3>
          <p>iGenius attracts financially ambitious individuals, frustrated traditional investors seeking better tools, young professionals interested in market trading, crypto enthusiasts wanting structured education, and entrepreneurs looking for technology-enabled income streams. The appeal centers on financial empowerment—access to institutional-quality tools, education that demystifies complex markets, and community support from like-minded traders. The business opportunity draws finance-curious networkers, tech-savvy marketers, trading hobbyists wanting to monetize their passion, and individuals seeking alternative income beyond traditional employment. Success requires credibility in financial discussions and comfort with technology platforms—prospects must trust your financial competence, not just your recruiting skills.</p>
          <p class="muted">The credibility factor is critical—positioning yourself as financial educator rather than MLM recruiter determines whether serious prospects engage or dismiss the opportunity immediately.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>How iGenius Global Distributes</h3>
          <p>iGenius provides affiliates with platform access, educational content libraries, trading tool tutorials, market analysis resources, demo accounts, and compensation plans rewarding subscription sales and team development. The direct selling model emphasizes financial education delivery, technology onboarding, trading concept explanation, and community building around shared financial goals. Training covers platform navigation, trading fundamentals, market analysis interpretation, risk management principles, subscription value positioning, and regulatory compliance with financial services marketing. iGenius focuses on building educated communities of traders rather than hype-driven recruiting typical of some financial opportunities.</p>
          <p class="muted">Key insight: iGenius's technology platform is the product—your recruiting effectiveness depends on demonstrating platform value and educational quality, not just income opportunity hype.</p>

        <h2>Training & Onboarding Snapshot</h2>
        <p>iGenius training emphasizes financial literacy fundamentals, platform functionality, trading concept education, market analysis techniques, risk management principles, subscription positioning, and compliance with financial marketing regulations. Corporate provides learning management systems, trading simulators, market analysis webinars, and leadership development focused on financial education delivery. The challenge: traditional iGenius recruiting relies heavily on income testimonials, trading results screenshots, and opportunity presentations—automated financial literacy assessment funnels, progressive education sequences, and AI-powered prospect qualification by existing financial knowledge level are typically underdeveloped in most affiliates' systems.</p>

        <p><strong>Compliance note:</strong> Stay within iGenius Global's policies and your local regulations. Never guarantee trading profits or investment returns—emphasize education and tools, not financial outcomes. Be transparent about trading risks and potential capital loss. Verify financial services marketing compliance in your jurisdiction. Use official income disclosure statements when discussing business opportunity earnings. Only share platform performance data from official company sources. Avoid positioning as financial advice unless properly licensed.</p>
        <p>When in doubt, let the system do the heavy lifting—consistent financial literacy assessments, progressive education sequences, and risk-transparent positioning work better than hype or unrealistic profit claims.</p>
