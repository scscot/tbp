## Detailed Commit Message

fix: resolve login routing issues and homepage rendering errors

PROBLEM RESOLVED:
- Users experienced blank/black screen after logout→login cycle
- Homepage had RenderFlex overflow errors (80px on right)
- Animation controller disposal errors causing crashes
- Login button positioning caused layout overflow

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
- LoginScreen's initState() created persistent auth listener
- Auth listener caused navigation loops after logout→login
- Login button positioned too far right (right: 24px)
- Animation controllers not properly checking mounted state

CHANGES MADE:

LoginScreen (lib/screens/login_screen.dart):
- REMOVED: Problematic authentication listener in initState()
- ADDED: Direct navigation after successful authentication
- FIXED: Both email/password and social login methods
- ADDED: Proper mounted state checks before navigation

HomepageScreen (lib/screens/homepage_screen.dart):
- FIXED: Login button positioning (right: 24 → 16px)
- OPTIMIZED: Button padding (20,12 → 12,8px)
- REDUCED: Font sizes (14 → 12px) to prevent overflow
- ADDED: Mounted state check for animation controller
- RESOLVED: RenderFlex overflow by 80 pixels error

Main App Flow (lib/main.dart):
- VERIFIED: AuthWrapper correctly handles user state changes
- CONFIRMED: Navigation flow works for all authentication states

TESTING COMPLETED:
✅ Login/logout cycle - no blank screens
✅ Multiple authentication methods (email, Google, Apple)
✅ Layout rendering on various screen sizes
✅ Animation performance and disposal
✅ Navigation stack management
✅ Authentication state persistence

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Removed auth stream listener causing navigation loops
- Implemented direct Navigator.pop() after successful auth
- Optimized UI component sizing to prevent overflow
- Added proper widget lifecycle management
- Fixed memory leaks in animation controllers

IMPACT:
- Eliminates blank screen bug affecting user login experience
- Resolves all layout overflow errors on homepage
- Improves app stability with proper resource disposal
- Provides seamless authentication flow for all login methods

FILES MODIFIED:
- lib/screens/login_screen.dart
- lib/screens/homepage_screen.dart
