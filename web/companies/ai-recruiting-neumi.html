        <h2>What Neumi Sells (in plain English)</h2>
        <p>Neumi is a fast-growing wellness company founded by Steven K. Scott, approaching its 5th anniversary and already recognized as one of the fastest-growing network marketing companies globally. The core innovation is HydraStat Technology—a proprietary delivery system that breaks down large molecules and envelops them in ultra-pure water clusters for dramatically enhanced bioavailability. The flagship product is NutriSwish, a potent liquid supplement blending glutathione (the body's master antioxidant), L-cysteine (glutathione precursor), curcumin (anti-inflammatory turmeric extract), and vitamin C for maximum absorption. Neumi Skin applies the same glutathione technology topically for skincare benefits. The product portfolio focuses on cellular health, antioxidant support, and anti-aging from both internal and external approaches.</p>
        <p class="muted">Neumi's HydraStat Technology addresses the bioavailability challenge that plagues most supplements—ingredients that aren't absorbed provide zero benefit, making delivery mechanism the competitive differentiator.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Who Buys Neumi</h3>
          <p>Neumi attracts biohackers and wellness enthusiasts seeking advanced supplement technology, individuals researching glutathione for cellular health and detoxification, anti-aging consumers wanting both topical and internal approaches, health-conscious professionals seeking clean ingredient formulations, and people frustrated with traditional supplements that don't deliver results. The customer base skews 35-60 years old with above-average health literacy and willingness to invest in premium wellness solutions. The business opportunity appeals to wellness entrepreneurs, supplement industry veterans seeking cutting-edge products, network marketing professionals attracted to fast-growing companies, and health coaches monetizing their expertise.</p>
          <p class="muted">Rapidly expanding global presence with strong growth momentum in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific markets.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>How Neumi Distributes</h3>
          <p>Neumi operates a seven-level unilevel compensation plan paying affiliates on recruitment and retail sales with residual commissions through team depth. Qualification requires 100 PV (Personal Volume) monthly to earn commissions. Welcome Packs range from $100 (1 bottle NutriSwish + 1 bottle Neumi Skin) to $1,000 for larger starter packages. Basic affiliate membership costs $100 to $1,000 depending on entry level. The simplified structure makes onboarding straightforward while the young company status offers ground-floor positioning unusual in established network marketing. Fast growth trajectory creates momentum and excitement around business-building potential.</p>
          <p class="muted">Key insight: Young company means less market saturation—your warm market hasn't been approached by 5 other distributors yet, giving you first-mover advantage in your network.</p>

        <h2>Training & Onboarding Snapshot</h2>
        <p>Neumi emphasizes HydraStat Technology education, glutathione science, and bioavailability advantages in training. New affiliates learn about cellular health, antioxidant benefits, and product application through online training portals, team webinars, and upline mentorship. The company provides scientific explanations of molecular delivery mechanisms and comparison content versus traditional supplements. However, being a younger company, systematic digital marketing training, automated prospecting systems, and advanced duplication infrastructure are still developing. Most affiliates rely on personal enthusiasm and individual creativity for lead generation and team building without standardized playbooks.</p>

        <h2>Your AI Recruiting Playbook for Neumi</h2>
        <ol class="checklist" id="getting-started-list">
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Bioavailability-first messaging.</strong> Most people waste money on supplements their bodies can't absorb. Create content specifically addressing bioavailability problems with traditional pills and capsules. Position HydraStat as the solution. Use AI to target audiences already buying expensive supplements—they understand quality pricing and are frustrated with poor results.</li>
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Glutathione education sequences.</strong> Most prospects don't know what glutathione is or why it matters. Build a 5-day automated email course explaining the master antioxidant, cellular health, and detoxification. Gate it behind email opt-in. Educate first, sell second—this builds authority and filters serious buyers from tire-kickers.</li>
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Biohacker community targeting.</strong> Neumi's science-forward approach resonates with biohacking audiences. Create content for Reddit's r/Biohacking, longevity forums, and anti-aging communities. Use AI to systematically engage these groups with educational content positioning HydraStat as next-generation delivery technology.</li>
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Before-and-after energy tracking.</strong> Glutathione benefits often manifest as energy, mental clarity, and recovery improvements. Build AI-prompted daily check-ins for new customers tracking subjective wellness markers. Collect testimonials at 30, 60, and 90 days showing progressive improvement. Quantified self-data converts skeptics.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Ground-floor opportunity positioning.</strong> Neumi's young age is an advantage for recruiting business builders. Create content comparing the company's 5-year trajectory to established MLMs at their 5-year mark. Use AI to distribute to experienced network marketers looking for the next growth wave before market saturation.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Swish ritual habit formation.</strong> NutriSwish works best when used consistently. Build automated habit-formation sequences: morning routine integration tips, reminder notifications, usage tracking, and milestone celebrations at 7, 30, 60 days. Retention drives residual income—habits drive retention.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Topical + internal cross-sell.</strong> Customers buying NutriSwish are natural candidates for Neumi Skin and vice versa. Build automated 60-day cross-sell sequences introducing the complementary product. "You're supporting cellular health internally—here's the external approach" creates natural expansion without pushy upselling.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Getting Started with Neumi: Your First 30 Days</h2>
        <p class="muted">New to Neumi? Here's your step-by-step roadmap to launching your affiliate journey with HydraStat Technology and glutathione bioavailability:</p>
        <ol class="checklist" id="getting-started-list">
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Day 1-3: Foundation Setup</strong> — Complete your Neumi affiliate enrollment ($100-$1,000 depending on Welcome Pack level), order your personal product starter pack (at minimum NutriSwish for internal glutathione and Neumi Skin for topical application—experience both approaches), and set up your replicated website. Study the unilevel compensation plan—understand 100 PV monthly qualification requirement, seven-level depth commissions, rank progression, and residual income structure from team reorders.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 1: Personal HydraStat Experience</strong> — Begin your own 30-day NutriSwish protocol with daily swishing (hold liquid in mouth 60-90 seconds before swallowing for sublingual absorption, then swallow for GI absorption—follow bottle instructions). Use Neumi Skin topically on face and neck daily. Document your experience—energy levels, mental clarity, skin texture changes, recovery from workouts, overall vitality after 7 days. Your personal cellular health journey becomes your recruiting asset—"I've been using NutriSwish and Neumi Skin for a week and here's what I'm noticing."</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 1: HydraStat Technology & Glutathione Education</strong> — Study Neumi's breakthrough science: HydraStat Technology breaks down large molecules and envelops them in ultra-pure water clusters for dramatically enhanced bioavailability vs traditional supplements. Learn glutathione's role as master antioxidant supporting cellular health, detoxification, immune function, and anti-aging. Understand why most oral glutathione supplements fail (poor absorption) and how NutriSwish's delivery system solves this. Master the bioavailability positioning—absorption is everything, ingredients don't work if they don't get absorbed.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 2: Warm Market Outreach</strong> — Create your contact list of 50-100 people. Segment by wellness sophistication: biohackers and longevity enthusiasts (understand bioavailability), supplement buyers frustrated with poor results, anti-aging consumers (35-60 years old), health-conscious professionals seeking clean formulations, wellness coaches monetizing expertise, and network marketing pros seeking fast-growing ground-floor opportunities. Share your personal Week 1 HydraStat experience with appropriate contacts. Lead with bioavailability science, not sales pitch.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 2: Team Build Pro Setup</strong> — Download Team Build Pro to organize your prospect pipeline by interest category (biohacker, anti-aging, supplement buyer, business opportunity), track who's engaged with your glutathione education and HydraStat Technology content, and let qualified prospects start building their own teams before officially joining, so they launch with pre-built momentum in this fast-growing company.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 3: First Wellness Consultations</strong> — Conduct 10-15 consultations (virtual wellness calls, coffee meetups, biohacking group presentations). Use health goal questionnaires to identify needs—energy optimization, cellular health, anti-aging, detoxification support, athletic recovery. Explain HydraStat bioavailability advantage using simple comparisons: traditional pills 10-30% absorption vs NutriSwish enhanced delivery. Offer 30-day trials with specific outcome tracking. Emphasize Neumi's 5-year fast-growth trajectory for business-minded prospects—ground-floor positioning unusual in established MLM.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 3-4: First Customers & Monthly Subscriptions</strong> — Convert 5-10 consultation prospects to customers with NutriSwish monthly auto-ship (reach 100 PV minimum for commission qualification). Add Neumi Skin cross-sells where appropriate—internal + external cellular health synergy. Set up 14-day and 30-day check-in sequences tracking energy, clarity, skin improvements. Use customer results (with proper disclaimers) to recruit next wave. HydraStat technology demonstrates value quickly—customers feel differences within weeks, creating strong retention.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 4: First Affiliates</strong> — Identify 2-3 serious business builders—people experiencing noticeable NutriSwish benefits, understanding bioavailability science advantage, excited about young company momentum, and having networks in wellness/biohacking/supplement communities. Walk them through affiliate enrollment. Help them order their Welcome Pack and plan their first 10 wellness consultations for Week 5. Share your bioavailability education materials, customer assessment templates, and swish habit formation guides.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>First 30 Days: Bioavailability Education Playbook Duplication</strong> — Package your entire system—glutathione education mini-course, HydraStat Technology explainer (simple, not PhD thesis), bioavailability comparison chart (traditional pills vs NutriSwish absorption), 30-day wellness tracking templates, swish ritual habit formation guide, topical + internal synergy positioning, objection responses, and ground-floor opportunity overview—into a playbook your new affiliates can use to start consultations in 48 hours without needing biochemistry degrees.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Ongoing: Science-Based Team Growth</strong> — Use Team Build Pro to track your organization's customer reorder rates (retention is key for residual income), identify affiliates hitting rank milestones, maintain consistent communication across your team, and share the HydraStat bioavailability story that differentiates Neumi from commodity supplement MLMs. Neumi's young age (approaching year 5) and fast growth create ground-floor positioning—emphasize momentum and market opportunity before saturation. Focus on cellular health education, consistent swish habits, and bioavailability science rather than hype.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> New Neumi affiliates who complete personal 30-day NutriSwish protocols, convert 5+ customers with consistent reorders, and master bioavailability education within 60 days build teams with 4x higher retention. Team Build Pro helps you track wellness consultations, organize by biohacker/anti-aging categories, and duplicate your science-based education system as your team grows in this fast-expanding company.</p>

            <h3>Supplement buyer (bioavailability angle)</h3>
            <p>"Quick question—do you know if your supplements are actually absorbing? Most capsules have 10-30% bioavailability. Our HydraStat Technology solves that. I can send a 2-minute science video if you're curious."</p>

            <h3>Biohacker/longevity focused</h3>

            <h3>Anti-aging wellness buyer</h3>
            <p>"We approach aging from inside (glutathione for cellular health) and outside (topical glutathione skin serum). Both use the same HydraStat absorption technology. I have a product overview if that interests you."</p>

        <p><strong>Compliance note:</strong> <a href="https://neumi.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neumi</a> policies prohibit medical claims, disease treatment promises, and unapproved health benefit statements. Focus on bioavailability science, cellular health support, and general wellness experiences. Use official product pages and approved marketing materials. When discussing business opportunity, clarify that success requires consistent customer acquisition, monthly volume maintenance, and team development effort. Never claim products diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent disease.</p>
        <p>When in doubt, let the system do the heavy lifting—consistent glutathione education, automated wellness tracking, and habit formation sequences work better than exaggerated health claims or get-rich-quick income promises.</p>
