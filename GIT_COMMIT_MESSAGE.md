## Summary
feat: Add referral URL uniqueness validation and improve add_link_screen UX

## Detailed Changes

### FirestoreService (lib/services/firestore_service.dart)
- Added `checkReferralUrlUniqueness()` method to validate referral URL uniqueness
- Implements Firestore query to check for duplicate `biz_opp_ref_url` values
- Includes proper error handling and logging for debugging
- Returns boolean indicating if URL is unique (excluding current user's existing URL)

### AddLinkScreen (lib/screens/add_link_screen.dart)
- **Core Feature**: Integrated referral URL uniqueness validation into form submission
- **UI/UX Improvements**:
  - Fixed error message wrapping issues with shorter, clearer messages
  - Removed overly strict validation that caused false errors
  - Added detailed instruction box with bullet points and examples
  - Changed section title from "Enter Your Referral Link" to "Set Up Your Referral Link"
  - Added explanatory text about combining base URL with user identifier
- **Popup Dialog**: Added styled modal dialog for duplicate URL detection
  - Clear messaging about which business opportunity has the conflict
  - Professional styling with warning icons and branded colors
  - "Try Different Link" button to dismiss and retry
- **Validation Logic**: Simplified to prevent only spaces and obvious URL inputs
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of permission errors with safety-first approach

### Firestore Rules (firestore.rules)
- Updated rules to allow authenticated users to query users collection
- Changed from `allow read` to `allow get` for individual document access
- Added `allow list: if request.auth != null;` to enable collection queries
- Maintains security while allowing necessary uniqueness check queries

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Referral URL Uniqueness Check**: Prevents duplicate business opportunity referral URLs
2. **User-Friendly Error Handling**: Shows clear popup when duplicates are detected
3. **Improved Form Validation**: Simplified validation logic with better error messages
4. **Enhanced User Experience**: Clearer instructions and better visual feedback
5. **Security Compliance**: Proper Firestore rules for query permissions

### Technical Notes
- Uses Firestore `where` query to check for existing `biz_opp_ref_url` values
- Excludes current user's UID to allow users to update their own referral URL
- Implements safety-first error handling (assumes not unique on query failures)
- Maintains existing form functionality while adding new validation layer

### Testing Status
- Code compiles without errors
- Firestore rules manually verified and working
- Ready for integration testing of form submission and duplicate detection flows
