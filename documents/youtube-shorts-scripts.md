Value-first approach with subtle Team Build Pro positioning

---

## Script 1: The 75% Problem
**Hook:** "75% of new recruits quit in their first year. Here's why."

**Body:** "It's not because they're lazy. It's not because the product is bad. It's because they start from zero. No contacts. No momentum. No quick wins. The people who succeed? They build momentum BEFORE they need it. They have conversations lined up. They have people curious. Day one isn't starting from scratch—it's harvesting what they planted."

**CTA:** "Start building momentum before you need it."

---

## Script 2: The Cold Message Mistake
**Hook:** "Stop sending cold messages that sound like this..."

**Body:** "'Hey girl! You'd be PERFECT for my team!' Delete. Here's what works instead: Lead with genuine curiosity. Ask about THEM. 'I saw you're into fitness—how's that going?' Build a real conversation first. People join people they trust, not pitches they tolerate."

**CTA:** "Curiosity before pitch. Every time."

---

## Script 3: Why Your Team Doesn't Duplicate
**Hook:** "Your team won't duplicate. Here's the real reason."

**Body:** "It's not training. It's not motivation. It's complexity. If your system requires 47 steps, a spreadsheet, and a PhD in follow-ups... nobody's doing it. The teams that duplicate? Dead simple systems. One message. One follow-up. One tracker. Make it so easy a tired parent at 10pm can do it."

**CTA:** "Simplify everything."

---

## Script 4: The Objection Flip
**Hook:** "When someone says 'I don't have time'—don't argue."

**Body:** "Say this instead: 'That's exactly why I thought of you.' Wait, what? 'The people who succeed in this aren't the ones with extra time. They're the ones who need a Plan B because their current situation isn't sustainable.' You just turned their objection into their reason to listen."

**CTA:** "Flip objections into openings."

---

## Script 5: Pre-Building Changes Everything
**Hook:** "What if your new recruit already had 5 people interested before Day 1?"

**Body:** "Most people join a business and THEN start prospecting. Cold start. Zero momentum. What if they flipped it? Build interest while they're deciding. Share the opportunity. Gauge reactions. By the time they commit, they're not starting from scratch—they're launching with a head start."

**CTA:** "Pre-build before you commit."

---

## Script 6: The Follow-Up Formula
**Hook:** "80% of sales happen after the 5th follow-up. Most people stop at 2."

**Body:** "But here's the thing—follow-ups shouldn't feel like stalking. Space them out. Add value each time. Share a testimonial. Answer a question they didn't ask. Check in genuinely. The goal isn't to annoy them into joining. It's to stay relevant until the timing is right."

**CTA:** "Follow up with value, not pressure."

---

## Script 7: The Skeptic Script
**Hook:** "How to talk to someone who thinks MLM is a scam."

**Body:** "Don't defend. Don't argue. Say this: 'I get it. There's a lot of garbage out there. I was skeptical too. But here's what changed my mind...' Then share YOUR story. Not income claims. Not hype. Your honest experience. Skeptics don't trust companies. They trust people who acknowledge their concerns."

**CTA:** "Meet skepticism with honesty."

---

## Script 8: The 3-Foot Rule is Dead
**Hook:** "The 3-foot rule killed more businesses than it built."

**Body:** "Pitching everyone within 3 feet of you? That's how you lose friends and annoy strangers. Modern recruiting is about attraction, not ambush. Share your journey. Let people ask questions. Be interesting enough that THEY come to YOU. Pull, don't push."

**CTA:** "Attract, don't attack."

---

## Script 9: Your Warm Market Isn't Dead
**Hook:** "Think you've burned through your warm market? Think again."

**Body:** "People's lives change. The friend who said no 2 years ago? She might hate her job now. Your cousin who wasn't interested? Just had a baby and wants flexibility. Circle back—but not with a pitch. Check in genuinely. See what's changed. Timing is everything."

**CTA:** "Revisit with curiosity, not pressure."

---

## Script 10: The Real Reason People Say No
**Hook:** "When someone says no, they're usually not saying no to the business."

**Body:** "They're saying no to you asking. No to feeling sold. No to the uncomfortable moment. Sometimes they're saying 'not now.' Sometimes 'I don't trust this yet.' Your job isn't to overcome their no. It's to make the next conversation feel safe enough for them to be honest."

**CTA:** "Make honesty feel safe."

---

## Script 11: Stop Chasing, Start Sorting
**Hook:** "You're not looking for everyone. You're looking for your people."

**Body:** "Chasing people who aren't interested is exhausting and pointless. Your job is to sort, not convince. Some people will get it. Most won't. That's fine. The faster you find your people, the faster you build. Stop convincing. Start sorting."

**CTA:** "Sort, don't chase."

---

## Script 12: The Enrollment Conversation
**Hook:** "The best enrollment conversations don't feel like sales calls."

**Body:** "They feel like problem-solving sessions. 'What are you looking for?' 'What's not working right now?' 'What would need to change?' Listen more than you talk. When you understand their problem, you can show how you might help solve it. No pitch required."

**CTA:** "Solve problems, don't sell products."

---

## Script 13: Why New Recruits Ghost
**Hook:** "Your new recruit was excited for 3 days. Then they disappeared."

**Body:** "Here's why: They got overwhelmed. Too much training. Too many options. No clear first step. The fix? Give them ONE thing to do. One conversation to have. One win to chase. Stack small wins and they'll stick around. Drown them in information and they'll drown."

**CTA:** "One clear next step. Always."

---

## Script 14: The Income Claim Trap
**Hook:** "Income claims are killing your credibility."

**Body:** "'I made $10K my first month!' Cool. Nobody believes you. And if they do, they'll quit when they don't hit that. Instead: Share real results. Average outcomes. Honest timelines. 'It took me 6 months to replace my car payment.' Believable beats impressive."

**CTA:** "Honest beats hype."

---

## Script 15: Building When Nobody's Watching
**Hook:** "The hardest part of direct sales? Building when nobody's watching."

**Body:** "No likes. No comments. No sign-ups. Just you, doing the work. This is where most people quit. But here's the truth: Every conversation plants a seed. Every follow-up builds trust. The people who win are the ones who keep building when it feels pointless. Because it's not."

**CTA:** "Keep planting seeds."

---

## Script 16: The Partner Conversation
**Hook:** "Your spouse thinks your business is a waste of time. Here's how to handle it."

**Body:** "Don't argue. Don't defend. Ask this: 'What would you need to see to feel good about this?' Maybe it's a timeline. Maybe it's a specific result. Maybe it's less time spent. Get specific, then deliver. Actions beat arguments every time."

**CTA:** "Ask what they need to see."

---

## Script 17: Social Media Without Being Annoying
**Hook:** "How to post about your business without annoying everyone."

**Body:** "Rule 1: Be interesting first. Share your life. Your wins. Your struggles. Rule 2: Make business posts 20% or less of your content. Rule 3: Tell stories, not pitches. 'This happened to me' beats 'You should buy this' every single time."

**CTA:** "Stories over pitches."

---

## Script 18: The Duplication Test
**Hook:** "Here's how to know if your system will duplicate."

**Body:** "Ask yourself: Could a brand new person with zero experience do this in their first week? If the answer is no, simplify. Could they do it scared and nervous? If no, simplify more. The best systems work for the least experienced person on your team."

**CTA:** "Build for beginners."

---

## Script 19: Timing vs. Convincing
**Hook:** "You can't convince someone whose timing is wrong."

**Body:** "Some people need to get fired first. Or have a health scare. Or watch their friend succeed. You can plant seeds. You can stay visible. But you cannot create urgency that isn't there. Focus on the people who are ready NOW and nurture the rest for later."

**CTA:** "Find the ready ones first."

---

## Script 20: The Long Game
**Hook:** "Direct sales isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. It's a get-free-slow plan."

**Body:** "The real money? It comes from consistency over years, not hustle over weeks. The people who build six-figure incomes? They showed up for 3, 5, 10 years. Not sexy. But true. If you're looking for fast, look elsewhere. If you're building for freedom, you're in the right place."

**CTA:** "Play the long game."
