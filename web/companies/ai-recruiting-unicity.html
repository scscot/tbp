        <h2>What Unicity Sells (in plain English)</h2>
        <p>Unicity International is a global wellness company offering over 400 health and nutrition products sold through a direct selling model in 60+ countries. In 2021, Unicity launched the Feel Great brand as a focused foundational health system designed to make healthy living doable, affordable, and enjoyable. The Feel Great System centers on two core products: Unimate and Balance. Unimate supports energy and mood with yerba mate extract, while Balance helps manage appetite, digestion, and metabolic health with fiber and plant compounds. Beyond Feel Great, Unicity offers weight management programs, immune support supplements, skincare, digestive health products, and targeted wellness formulations. The company emphasizes helping customers work with their bodies naturally for sustainable health improvements.</p>
        <p class="muted">The Feel Great System's simplicity is strategic—two products, clear protocol, manageable price point, making it accessible for customers to start and easy for distributors to explain and duplicate.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Who Buys Unicity</h3>
          <p>Unicity attracts health-conscious consumers seeking metabolic wellness support, weight management customers looking for sustainable appetite and digestion control, busy professionals wanting simple daily health protocols, and wellness enthusiasts drawn to the Feel Great System's affordability and effectiveness. The business opportunity appeals to health and wellness champions wanting to build businesses around transformation, network marketers seeking product credibility and customer retention, and entrepreneurs attracted to Unicity's 60+ country infrastructure and three-level compensation approach with eight income streams. The low enrollment cost of just $40 makes starting accessible for most prospects.</p>
          <p class="muted">The two-product Feel Great System creates natural customer stickiness—people see results from the protocol, making monthly reorders habitual rather than decision-heavy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>How Unicity Distributes</h3>
          <p>Unicity provides Distributors with immediate wholesale pricing, personal e-commerce storefronts, marketing materials, and a three-level compensation plan with eight different income streams including retail profits, team commissions, and leadership bonuses. The company distinguishes between Members who enjoy wholesale pricing without MLM participation and Distributors who build businesses. Training emphasizes the Feel Great System protocol, metabolic health education, customer transformation tracking, and team duplication systems. Unicity's direct selling model allows customers to learn about products from people they know and trust rather than impersonal advertising, creating relationship-based business development.</p>
          <p class="muted">Key insight: Unicity's Member vs Distributor distinction lets you onboard customers at wholesale pricing first, prove product value over 30-60 days, then introduce business opportunity with credibility already established.</p>

        <h2>Training & Onboarding Snapshot</h2>
        <p>Unicity training focuses on the Feel Great System protocol, metabolic health fundamentals, Unimate and Balance usage timing, customer coaching for sustained results, transformation documentation, and business building systems. Corporate provides online learning platforms, product science education, regional health events, and annual conventions. The challenge: traditional Unicity recruiting emphasizes personal transformation stories and before-after results—systematizing prospect qualification, automating Feel Great protocol education, and creating duplicatable coaching frameworks for new Distributors requires strategic AI-powered content management and follow-up sequences.</p>

        <h2>Getting Started with Unicity: Your First 30 Days</h2>
        <p class="muted">New to Unicity? Here's your step-by-step roadmap to launching your Distributor journey with the Feel Great System and metabolic health focus:</p>
        <ol class="checklist" id="getting-started-list">
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Day 1-3: Foundation Setup</strong> — Complete your Unicity enrollment (decide between $40 Distributor sign-up for business or Member for wholesale pricing only—most builders start as Distributors), order your personal Feel Great System pack (includes Unimate yerba mate drink for energy/mood and Balance fiber supplement for appetite/digestion control), and set up your replicated website. Study the compensation plan—understand three-level structure with 8 income streams including retail profits, team commissions, customer acquisition bonuses, rank advancement from Distributor to Presidential Diamond, and global expansion opportunities across 60+ countries.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 1: Personal Feel Great Experience</strong> — Begin your own 30-day Feel Great protocol with daily Unimate and Balance usage. Follow the recommended timing: drink Unimate in the morning for sustained energy without jitters, take Balance before your two largest meals (dissolved in water 10-15 minutes before eating) to support appetite control and digestion. Document your experience—energy levels, appetite changes, digestive comfort, mood improvements, cravings reduction after 7 days. Your personal metabolic health journey becomes your strongest recruiting asset—"I've been doing Feel Great for a week and here's what I've noticed with my energy and appetite."</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 1: Feel Great System & Company Education</strong> — Study Unicity's positioning—over 400 wellness products sold in 60+ countries, with Feel Great System as focused foundational health making wellness doable, affordable, and enjoyable. Learn about Unimate's yerba mate science, Balance's fiber and plant compound benefits, metabolic health fundamentals, and how the two-product simplicity creates sustainable habits. Master the Member vs Distributor distinction—Members get wholesale pricing without business obligations, Distributors build teams and earn from 8 income streams.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 2: Warm Market Outreach</strong> — Create your contact list of 50-100 people. Segment by wellness interest: weight management seekers (appetite control positioning), busy professionals needing sustained energy without coffee crashes, digestive health concerns, metabolic wellness advocates, people who've tried complex supplement regimens and want something simpler, health and wellness enthusiasts already buying supplements, and business opportunity seekers. Share your personal Week 1 Feel Great experience with appropriate contacts. Lead with two-product simplicity and metabolic benefits, not sales pitch.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 2: Team Build Pro Setup</strong> — Download Team Build Pro to organize your prospect pipeline by wellness goal category (weight management, energy, digestion, metabolic health, business), track who's engaged with your Feel Great System education content, and let qualified prospects start building their own teams before officially joining, so they launch with pre-built momentum and deeper understanding of the protocol.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 3: First Feel Great Consultations</strong> — Conduct 10-15 wellness consultations (virtual health assessments, coffee meetups to discuss metabolic health, small group Feel Great information sessions). Use health goal questionnaires to identify primary needs—weight management, sustained energy, appetite control, digestive support, overall metabolic wellness. Explain the Feel Great protocol timing: Unimate in morning for energy, Balance before two largest meals for appetite/digestion. Offer 30-day trial with specific outcome tracking. Position Member option for those wanting to try products first without business commitment.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 3-4: First Customers & Monthly Reorders</strong> — Convert 5-10 consultation prospects to customers with Feel Great System subscriptions (start most as Members at wholesale pricing—builds credibility before introducing business opportunity). Focus on monthly auto-ship for consistency—Feel Great works best with daily protocol adherence. Track 30-day transformation feedback—weight changes, energy improvements, appetite control success, digestive comfort. Use customer results (with proper disclaimers) to recruit next wave. The Member-first approach lets products prove themselves before business conversation.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 4: First Distributors</strong> — Identify 2-3 serious business builders—people experiencing noticeable Feel Great benefits, understanding the two-product simplicity advantage for duplication, and having strong networks in health-conscious communities or professional circles seeking side income. Walk them through Distributor enrollment (transition from Member if they started that way). Help them order their Feel Great pack and plan their first 10 wellness consultations for Week 5. Share your health assessment questionnaire, protocol explanation videos, and Member-first positioning scripts.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>First 30 Days: Feel Great Coaching Playbook Duplication</strong> — Package your entire system—health goal assessment questionnaire, Unimate and Balance science education (one-pagers, not medical textbooks), Feel Great protocol timing guide, 30-day tracking templates by goal type, Member vs Distributor positioning flowchart, objection responses, compensation plan simplified overview, and customer success stories—into a simple playbook your new Distributors can use to start consultations in 48 hours without needing nutrition degrees.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Ongoing: Metabolic Health-Based Team Growth</strong> — Use Team Build Pro to track your organization's customer reorder rates, identify Distributors hitting rank milestones, maintain consistent communication across your team, and share the Feel Great System's two-product simplicity that creates duplicatable success. Unicity's Member-first approach reduces business opportunity resistance—people try products, see personal results, then naturally explore income potential. Focus on protocol education, transformation tracking, and sustainable metabolic health rather than hype.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> New Unicity Distributors who complete personal 30-day Feel Great protocols, convert 5+ customers with consistent reorders through Member-first positioning, and master metabolic health education within 60 days build teams with 4x higher retention. Team Build Pro helps you track wellness consultations, organize by health goal category, and duplicate your Feel Great coaching system as your team grows.</p>

        <p><strong>Compliance note:</strong> Stay within <a href="https://unicity.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unicity</a>'s policies and your local regulations. Avoid income guarantees—earning compensation takes considerable dedication, time, and effort, and compensation varies significantly among Distributors. For health claims, emphasize wellness support and metabolic health benefits, not disease treatment. Encourage customers to consult healthcare providers before starting any supplement program.</p>
        <p>When in doubt, let the system do the heavy lifting—consistent Feel Great System education, transformation tracking, and Member-first positioning work better than hype.</p>
