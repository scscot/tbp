        <h2>What LimeLife by Alcone Sells (in plain English)</h2>
        <p>LimeLife by Alcone bridges professional makeup artistry with everyday consumer accessibility, built on Alcone Company's 60+ year legacy as the trusted makeup supplier for Broadway, film, television, and professional makeup artists. The product line features long-wear cosmetics engineered for stage performance durability yet wearable for daily life—Perfect Foundation (buildable coverage with skincare benefits), Enduring Lip Color (8-hour wear without feathering), Perfect Pressed Powder (HD-ready finish), Eye Got This Liner (waterproof precision), and Bestie Eye Shadow Palettes (highly pigmented, blendable formulas). The skincare collection includes Moisture Boost Serum, Eye Bright Depuffer, and Dream Team Night Cream. LimeLife emphasizes clean beauty ingredients, cruelty-free formulations, and professional-quality application tools. The company operates across eight countries (US, Canada, UK, Ireland, Germany, France, Spain, Austria) with no monthly minimums, starter kits from $29, and 20% product discounts for Beauty Guides.</p>
        <p class="muted">LimeLife's Alcone heritage differentiates from typical direct-sales cosmetics—professional makeup artists trust Alcone for Broadway shows and film sets, bringing that same performance-tested quality to everyday consumers through the Beauty Guide model.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Who Buys LimeLife</h3>
          <p>LimeLife attracts busy professionals seeking long-wear makeup that survives commutes and workdays, makeup enthusiasts who want professional artistry results without salon prices, women transitioning from department store brands seeking cleaner ingredient alternatives, theater and performance artists familiar with Alcone's professional reputation, and international customers across eight countries seeking accessible luxury cosmetics. The customer base spans ages 25-60 with emphasis on quality-conscious consumers who value performance over trends. The business opportunity appeals to makeup artists and estheticians seeking flexible income, beauty influencers wanting professional-grade products, moms building businesses around school schedules, former retail beauty employees seeking entrepreneurship, and international networkers capitalizing on multi-country operations.</p>
          <p class="muted">Strong appeal to "performance beauty" seekers—LimeLife's stage-tested durability resonates with professionals, performers, and busy women who need makeup that lasts 8-12 hours without touch-ups.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>How LimeLife Distributes</h3>
          <p>LimeLife operates a simplified compensation plan offering 20-40% commissions based on sales volume, 20% personal product discount, team building overrides across multiple generations, and international expansion opportunities. Beauty Guides earn through direct retail sales (personal website, social selling), virtual beauty experiences (online makeup tutorials and consultations), and team building with generational depth. The company emphasizes no monthly purchase requirements, no mandatory inventory, and starter kits beginning at $29. Rank progression includes Beauty Guide, Team Leader, Senior Leader, Executive, and Presidential levels with increasing commission percentages and leadership bonuses. Guides can focus purely on retail customers or build international teams across eight countries.</p>
          <p class="muted">Key insight: No monthly minimums combined with $29 starter kits eliminate financial pressure—Beauty Guides share professional makeup artistry passion without inventory stress or qualification anxiety.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Training & Onboarding Snapshot</h2>
        <p>LimeLife emphasizes professional makeup application techniques, Alcone heritage storytelling, and virtual beauty experience hosting. New Beauty Guides learn about makeup artistry fundamentals (color theory, skin tone matching, application techniques), product performance benefits (long-wear technology, clean ingredients, professional durability), and virtual party hosting through online training modules, live makeup demonstrations, and upline mentorship. The company provides application tutorial videos, product comparison guides, and social selling templates. However, traditional training focuses on makeup techniques and party hosting—leaving systematic digital prospecting, automated customer follow-up sequences, international market content strategies, and scalable beauty enthusiast acquisition largely unaddressed. Most guides struggle translating makeup passion into consistent recruiting conversations beyond immediate beauty networks.</p>

        <ol class="checklist" id="getting-started-list">
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Alcone professional heritage storytelling.</strong> Create content showcasing Alcone's 60+ year legacy supplying makeup for Broadway, film, and television productions.

Use AI to systematically share heritage content in theater communities, performing arts groups, and professional makeup artist networks. Position LimeLife as professional-to-consumer innovation.</li>
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Long-wear performance demonstrations.</strong> Target busy professionals, working moms, and event attendees needing 8-12 hour makeup durability.

        <h2>Getting Started with LimeLife: Your First 30 Days</h2>
        <p class="muted">New to LimeLife by Alcone? Here's your step-by-step roadmap to launching your Beauty Guide journey with professional makeup artistry and international reach:</p>
        <ol class="checklist" id="getting-started-list">
          <li class="always-visible"><strong>Day 1-3: Foundation Setup</strong> — Complete your LimeLife Beauty Guide enrollment, order your starter kit with Perfect Foundation (your shade match), Enduring Lip Color, Eye Got This Liner, Bestie Eye Shadow Palette, and Perfect Pressed Powder, and set up your personal replicated website. Study the compensation plan structure—understand 20-40% commissions, 20% personal discount, no monthly minimums policy, and rank advancement from Beauty Guide through Presidential levels. Explore international market opportunities across eight countries.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 1: Personal Makeup Experience</strong> — Wear your LimeLife products daily for seven consecutive days. Apply Perfect Foundation in morning, test long-wear claims through full workdays, photograph your makeup at hour 1, hour 6, and hour 10, document skin reaction to clean ingredients, and compare durability to your previous department store products. Your 7-day wear-test becomes your strongest recruiting tool—"I switched to LimeLife and my makeup lasted through 12-hour days without touch-ups."</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 1: Alcone Heritage Deep Dive</strong> — Study Alcone Company's 60+ year history supplying professional makeup artists for Broadway, film, and television. Learn the professional-to-consumer story: why stage makeup durability translates to everyday long-wear performance, how theater artists' needs (hot lights, long performances, HD cameras) created superior formulations now accessible through LimeLife. Master the heritage story for prospects who question direct sales cosmetics quality.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 2: Warm Market Beauty Outreach</strong> — Create your contact list of 50-100 people. Segment by beauty interest: busy professionals needing long-wear makeup, makeup enthusiasts seeking professional quality, clean beauty seekers wanting ingredient transparency, former beauty retail employees exploring entrepreneurship, and international contacts in LimeLife's eight operating countries. Share your personal Week 1 wear-test results. Focus on performance demonstration, not product pushing.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 2: Team Build Pro Setup</strong> — Download Team Build Pro to organize your prospect pipeline by beauty interest (performance seekers, clean beauty advocates, professional artists, business builders), track who's engaging with your makeup demonstration content, and let qualified prospects start building their own teams before officially joining, so they launch with pre-built momentum in LimeLife's no-minimum environment.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 3: First Virtual Beauty Experiences</strong> — Host 2-3 virtual makeup tutorials (via Zoom, Facebook Live, or Instagram Live). Demonstrate Perfect Foundation application, show Enduring Lip Color durability test, teach Eye Got This Liner techniques for different eye shapes, and share Alcone professional tips. Invite 15-20 people per event (aim 5-8 attendees). Use LimeLife's virtual party templates. Follow up within 24 hours with product recommendations and business opportunity conversations.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 3-4: First Customers & Commission Earnings</strong> — Convert 5-10 virtual event attendees to customers. Focus on starter collections: Perfect Foundation + Enduring Lip Color duo, Eye Got This + Bestie Palette eye set, or full-face foundation kits. Earn 20-30% commission per sale depending on volume. Emphasize no subscription requirements—customers reorder when they choose. Use Team Build Pro to track customer reorder timing (typically 45-90 days for makeup repurchase).</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Week 4: First Beauty Guides & Team Building</strong> — Identify 1-2 serious business builders—people who achieved visible makeup results with LimeLife products, understand professional artistry value proposition, have beauty enthusiast networks (makeup artists, estheticians, beauty influencers), or seek international opportunity across eight countries. Walk them through Beauty Guide enrollment with $29 starter kit. Help them schedule their first virtual beauty experience for Week 5. Share your application techniques and Alcone heritage resources.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>First 30 Days: Professional Artistry Content Strategy</strong> — Post daily "makeup artistry" content on social media: before-after transformations showing long-wear performance, professional application technique tutorials, Alcone heritage stories (Broadway makeup secrets), clean ingredient education. Share your personal makeup journey with specific wear-time observations. Use AI to schedule posts, respond to technique questions, and convert engagement into virtual beauty experience invitations. Position yourself as the "professional makeup educator" in your network.</li>
          <li class="collapsible-item" style="display: none;"><strong>Ongoing: Professional Beauty System</strong> — Use Team Build Pro to track your customer reorder cycles (makeup typically 60-90 days), identify prospects ready for virtual beauty experiences, maintain consistent communication across your international team, and duplicate your professional artistry system. Focus on monthly metrics: 20-30% commission per customer order, host 4-6 virtual beauty experiences monthly, convert 40% of attendees to customers, recruit 2-3 new Beauty Guides monthly, and explore international markets where professional makeup and clean beauty movements are strong. Your Alcone heritage passion combined with systematic virtual experiences creates sustainable global beauty business growth.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> New LimeLife Beauty Guides who complete their personal 7-day wear-test, host 2-3 virtual experiences in first month, convert 5+ beauty enthusiast customers, and recruit their first Guide within 60 days create teams that are 5x more sustainable. Team Build Pro helps you track customer reorder timing (critical for makeup repurchase), organize virtual events by beauty interest category, and duplicate your professional artistry system as your international team grows across eight countries.</p>
