        <h2>What Riman Sells (in plain English)</h2>
        <p>Riman is a premium Korean beauty company offering luxury skincare products formulated with advanced K-beauty technology, proprietary ingredients, and decades of Korean cosmetic science expertise. The product line features anti-aging serums, hydrating essences, brightening treatments, specialty masks, cleansers, and complete skincare regimens designed around Korean beauty philosophy of prevention, hydration, and multi-step routines. Founded in Korea with expansion into North American and international markets, Riman positions itself as bringing authentic Korean beauty innovation to consumers seeking premium alternatives to mass-market skincare. The direct sales model allows brand partners to share products through personal recommendations, skincare consultations, social selling, and team building—combining passion for Korean beauty with entrepreneurial income opportunity.</p>
        <p class="muted">The Korean beauty heritage is Riman's competitive edge—you're not just selling skincare, you're offering authentic K-beauty expertise and access to formulations developed in the world's most advanced skincare market.</p>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Who Buys Riman Products</h3>
          <p>Riman customers are K-beauty enthusiasts, skincare aficionados seeking clinical-grade results, anti-aging focused consumers, beauty influencers wanting premium content, and individuals who prioritize skincare investment over makeup spending. The appeal centers on Korean innovation—ingredients like snail mucin, ginseng, fermented extracts, and proprietary complexes not readily available in Western drugstore brands. The business opportunity attracts beauty industry professionals wanting high-quality product lines, skincare educators seeking premium offerings, aestheticians expanding income streams, and entrepreneurs passionate about self-care and beauty. Success requires genuine skincare knowledge and authentic enthusiasm—prospects can detect when someone loves the products versus just pushing opportunity.</p>
          <p class="muted">The authenticity factor is critical—brand partners who genuinely use and love Riman products convert better than those focused purely on compensation plans.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>How Riman Distributes</h3>
          <p>Riman provides brand partners with e-commerce platforms, product education resources, Korean beauty philosophy training, ingredient documentation, skincare routine builders, social media content templates, and compensation plans rewarding both sales and team development. The direct selling model emphasizes skincare consultation, personalized routine creation, results documentation, content creation showcasing product usage, and community building around shared beauty goals. Training covers Korean beauty fundamentals, ingredient science, skin type analysis, routine customization, anti-aging strategies, and professional representation of premium products. Riman focuses on developing educated beauty consultants who can authentically represent Korean skincare philosophy.</p>
          <p class="muted">Key insight: Riman's premium positioning requires consultative selling skills—your recruiting effectiveness depends on building beauty credibility, not just sharing opportunity links.</p>

        <h2>Training & Onboarding Snapshot</h2>
        <p>Riman training emphasizes Korean beauty history and philosophy, ingredient science education, skin type consultation techniques, multi-step routine design, anti-aging protocol development, social media content creation for beauty, and premium product positioning. Corporate provides learning platforms, product certifications, routine building tools, and leadership development focused on beauty expertise cultivation. The challenge: traditional Riman recruiting relies heavily on before-and-after photos, product testimonials, and personal skincare journeys—automated skin concern assessment funnels, ingredient education sequences, and AI-powered routine customization based on prospect's specific concerns are typically underdeveloped in most brand partners' systems.</p>

        <h2>Getting Started with Riman: Your First 30 Days</h2>
        <p class="muted">New to Riman? Here's your step-by-step roadmap to launching your Korean beauty brand partner journey with premium skincare positioning and multi-step routine mastery:</p>
        <ol class="checklist">
          <li><strong>Day 1-3: Foundation & Personal Skincare Journey</strong> — Complete your Riman brand partner enrollment and order your personal skincare starter kit immediately (required for credibility—you cannot sell Korean beauty products you don't personally use daily on your own skin). Study the compensation plan structure (retail profit margins, Fast Start bonuses, team building overrides, rank advancement milestones, international expansion opportunities). Purchase a core product set matching your primary skin concerns—anti-aging serum and moisturizer if aging is your focus, brightening essentials if hyperpigmentation concerns you, sensitive skin formulations if you experience irritation with other brands. Begin your personal Korean beauty routine from Day 1, documenting your experience meticulously—take high-quality before photos in consistent lighting (morning natural light is best), note initial skin texture, tone evenness, fine lines or wrinkles, hydration level, and any problem areas. Start with a simple 3-5 step routine if you're new to K-beauty—cleanser, toner or essence, serum, moisturizer, SPF in morning—rather than overwhelming yourself with a 10-step regimen immediately. Document your daily routine with photos—product lineup shots, application techniques, morning and evening rituals—because this authentic journey documentation becomes your most powerful marketing content in weeks ahead.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 1: Korean Beauty Philosophy & Ingredient Education</strong> — Spend 7 days immersing in K-beauty philosophy, Riman's unique ingredient positioning, and the science behind multi-step skincare routines to build consultation confidence. Study the Korean skincare philosophy fundamentals—emphasis on prevention over correction, gentle consistent care versus harsh treatments, hydration layering for plump youthful skin, ingredient efficacy over marketing hype. Learn Riman's hero ingredient stories—if products feature snail mucin (skin repair and hydration), fermented extracts (enhanced absorption and probiotics for skin), peptides (collagen stimulation for firmness), ceramides (barrier repair), or other signature actives, understand what each ingredient does and why Korean formulations optimize concentrations. Review the multi-step routine logic—each step serves specific purpose (double cleanse removes all impurities, toner preps skin for absorption, essence delivers concentrated actives, serum targets specific concerns, moisturizer seals everything in, SPF protects from damage). Study ingredient concentration transparency—Korean beauty brands often disclose percentages and emphasize clinical-level actives versus mass-market brands with trace amounts of hyped ingredients. Practice explaining these concepts conversationally without overwhelming prospects—"K-beauty focuses on keeping your skin healthy long-term rather than quick fixes that damage your skin barrier" or "These serums have clinical concentrations of peptides, not just marketing trace amounts." This educational foundation positions you as beauty advisor rather than salesperson, building trust and credibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 1: Personal Skin Transformation Documentation System</strong> — Establish rigorous documentation protocols for your own skin journey that will become authentic marketing content and teach you the realistic timelines for customer results. Take weekly progress photos in identical conditions—same location, same natural lighting (by window in morning), same time of day, no makeup, hair pulled back, neutral expression. Photograph multiple angles—straight-on face shot, both side profiles, close-ups of concern areas (around eyes for lines, cheeks for texture, forehead for tone evenness). Track subjective improvements daily in journal or notes app—skin texture smoothness, hydration plumpness feel, makeup application ease, compliments received from others, confidence level changes. Monitor product usage patterns—which products you look forward to applying, which steps feel tedious, how long your morning and evening routines actually take, any irritation or breakout reactions. Document unexpected improvements—many users notice benefits they didn't anticipate, like reduced redness, smaller pores, fewer breakouts, faster healing of blemishes, glowier complexion beyond their initial concern. This detailed personal documentation serves multiple purposes: proves to yourself that Riman works (critical for authentic selling), teaches you realistic result timelines to set proper customer expectations, creates before-after content for future marketing, and helps you understand which products deliver the most visible improvements.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 2: Skin Concern Assessment & Prospect List Building</strong> — Create your initial prospect list of 20-30 people who are ideal Riman customers based on skin concern awareness, beauty product investment habits, and Korean beauty curiosity. List beauty enthusiasts in your network—friends who follow skincare routines, colleagues who discuss beauty products, social media connections who post about makeup and skincare, people who already invest in Sephora or prestige beauty brands. Include people with visible skin concerns you could help—friends with aging concerns (fine lines, loss of firmness), hyperpigmentation issues (melasma, sun damage, acne scarring), active breakouts or acne-prone skin, dryness or sensitivity complaints. Add K-beauty curious prospects—people who've mentioned interest in Korean skincare trends, watch K-dramas or consume Korean culture content, travel to Korea or express interest in Asian beauty standards. Include wellness-oriented professionals—women in health/fitness industries, estheticians, makeup artists, hair stylists, spa workers who appreciate premium ingredient science. List international connections if you have them—Riman operates globally with particular strength in Asian markets, so friends in Korea, Japan, China, or Southeast Asia may respond to Korean beauty authenticity. Organize your list by warmth (close friends first who will support your new venture) and by skin concern specificity (people with clear problems you can solve convert faster than general "interested in beauty" prospects). This strategic targeting ensures your initial consultations have maximum relevance and conversion probability.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 2-3: Skin Consultation Framework & Assessment Practice</strong> — Develop a simple, repeatable skin consultation system that identifies prospect concerns, recommends appropriate Riman products, and positions you as knowledgeable beauty advisor without requiring esthetician credentials. Create basic assessment questionnaire covering essential information—current skin concerns (aging, acne, dryness, sensitivity, uneven tone), current skincare routine (none, basic cleanser/moisturizer, or elaborate multi-step), product preferences (fragrance-free, specific ingredient interests, texture preferences), budget comfort for premium skincare, and results timeline expectations. Learn to identify common skin types and concerns through conversation and observation—oily/acne-prone skin (shine, visible pores, breakouts), dry/dehydrated (tight feeling, flaking, dull appearance), aging concerns (fine lines around eyes, loss of firmness in jawline, sun damage spots), sensitive skin (redness, irritation from products, reactive). Practice recommending starter product combinations for different concerns—anti-aging protocol (gentle cleanser + peptide serum + rich moisturizer + SPF), brightening routine (vitamin C essence + niacinamide serum + barrier repair cream), acne solution (salicylic cleanser + lightweight hydration + spot treatment if Riman offers). Develop consultation language that provides helpful guidance without making medical claims—"Many customers with similar concerns see improvements in 4-8 weeks" rather than "This will cure your acne." Practice 10-15 minute consultation conversations with friends—ask questions, listen actively to their concerns, recommend 2-3 specific Riman products with usage instructions, explain realistic timelines, and offer to follow up in 2 weeks to discuss their experience. This consultation practice builds confidence and refines your recommendation framework before approaching paying customers.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 3: Initial Customer Consultations & Sample Strategy</strong> — Conduct 8-12 skin consultations with warm market prospects using your assessment framework, offering product recommendations and sample experiences to reduce purchase resistance. Reach out to your warmest prospects with consultation offers—"I'm building my Korean beauty business with Riman and offering free skin consultations—can I ask about your skincare routine and recommend some products?" Conduct consultations using your assessment framework—ask about concerns, current routine, goals, budget comfort—then recommend 2-4 specific Riman products explaining why each addresses their needs. Offer sample experiences when appropriate—Riman provides sampling programs, or you can decant from your personal products into small containers (check compliance policies) so prospects trial products before committing to full-size purchases. Provide detailed usage instructions with samples—when to apply (morning vs evening), how much to use, where in their routine sequence, what to expect in first week (sometimes skin purges before improving), and realistic timeline for visible results (typically 4-8 weeks for significant changes). Schedule follow-up conversations 7-10 days after sample delivery—"How's your skin responding to the serum? Notice any texture changes?"—to assess experience, answer questions, and guide toward purchase. Track consultation outcomes meticulously—who showed high interest, who ordered samples, who had budget concerns, who seemed entrepreneurial about the business opportunity—so you prioritize follow-up strategically and learn which prospect types convert best.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 3-4: First Customer Enrollments & Results Support</strong> — Convert 3-5 sample users or consultation prospects into paying Riman customers by addressing objections, emphasizing premium quality positioning, and providing exceptional onboarding support that ensures they achieve results. Follow up with sample users asking specific questions—"How did your skin feel after using the serum for a week? Notice any improvements in hydration or texture?" Address price objections through premium positioning—calculate cost-per-use (expensive-looking $80 serum lasts 3-4 months with daily use, making it $0.67 per day), compare ingredient concentrations to mass-market brands (clinical peptide levels versus trace amounts), emphasize Korean formulation expertise and manufacturing standards. Leverage your personal transformation story—"I was skeptical about the price too, but look at my skin after 3 weeks—I've never gotten these results from drugstore products." Offer starter bundles that provide complete routines rather than single products—customers achieve better results with proper cleansing, treatment, and moisturizing sequences, increasing satisfaction and reducing returns. Provide detailed onboarding when someone makes first purchase—send written usage instructions, offer to answer questions via text/DM, check in after their first week using products, share encouragement about being patient for results (4-8 weeks typical). Encourage before photo documentation—"Take a photo today before you start—in 4 weeks you'll be amazed at the difference." Celebrate first customer enrollments and commit to supporting their success, because satisfied customers with visible results become your best marketing and recruiting pipeline.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 4: Business Opportunity Introduction & Beauty Entrepreneur Recruiting</strong> — Identify entrepreneurial prospects from your customer consultations and introduce the Riman brand partner opportunity to 3-5 candidates who show natural interest in beauty, business, or Korean culture. Watch for entrepreneurial signals during customer conversations—prospects who ask lots of questions about products, express excitement about Korean beauty trends, mention they tell friends about skincare, or comment "I should be doing this!" Approach warm prospects with business curiosity—"You're so passionate about skincare and K-beauty—have you thought about the brand partner side? There's a business opportunity with Riman." Share the income potential overview—explain retail profit margins on direct sales, Fast Start bonuses for initial momentum, team building overrides, rank advancement opportunities, and international expansion potential as Riman grows globally. Highlight the Korean beauty market advantage—K-beauty is trending globally, premium positioning supports healthy margins, consumable products create recurring customer income versus one-time tech sales, and authentic Korean formulations differentiate from generic wellness MLMs. Emphasize the beauty community aspect—building a business around something you're passionate about (skincare, beauty, helping people feel confident) rather than forcing yourself to sell products you don't care about. Provide enrollment information and compensation plan summary, discussing startup investment and monthly product requirements for staying active. Offer to sponsor them personally if interested—explain your support system, consultation framework they can duplicate, your content and training they'll access, and how they'd plug into team structure. Even if no one enrolls in Week 4, planting business seeds positions you as team builder and creates future recruiting pipeline when customers achieve results and gain confidence in products.</li>
          <li><strong>Day 30: Master AI Playbook & Consultation Automation Systems</strong> — Implement the AI recruiting tactics from this guide to systematize skin assessments, automate ingredient education, and create duplication systems for future brand partners on your team. Build or adopt skin concern assessment automation—interactive quiz asking about skin type, primary concerns, current routine complexity, budget for premium skincare, generating personalized Riman product recommendations with Korean beauty philosophy explanations. Create ingredient education automation—comprehensive content libraries explaining hero Korean ingredients (snail mucin repair benefits, fermented extract absorption science, peptide collagen technology, ceramide barrier protection) with AI personalizing content depth based on prospect's skincare knowledge and engagement signals. Develop concern-based lane routing—segment prospects into anti-aging, brightening, acne-prone, sensitive skin, or hydration-focused lanes, each receiving customized nurture sequences with concern-specific product protocols, usage instructions, transformation stories, and realistic results timelines. Design routine complexity progression sequences—meet prospects where they are with simple 3-step routines for beginners, advancing to comprehensive 10-step K-beauty regimens for enthusiasts based on engagement and commitment signals. Implement results documentation systems—protocols for capturing customer progress photos (consistent lighting and timing guidance), routine adherence tracking, and transformation timeline sharing, with AI distributing relevant success stories to prospects matching their skin concerns and age demographics. Build premium value justification sequences—content explaining cost-per-use calculations, ingredient concentration comparisons versus drugstore brands, long-term skin health investment philosophy, positioning premium pricing as skincare portfolio building rather than expensive purchases. The goal is packaging your entire consultation system—assessment quiz, ingredient education, routine builder, transformation documentation, objection handling—so new brand partners launch with beauty credibility and proven playbook rather than starting from scratch without skincare expertise.</li>
          <li><strong>Ongoing: Results-Driven Beauty Community & Authority Building</strong> — Commit to building authentic beauty authority by consistently sharing your personal skin journey, customer transformations, ingredient education, and Korean beauty culture content that attracts ideal prospects and creates natural business growth. Continue your personal Riman routine indefinitely and document long-term results—take monthly progress photos comparing to your Day 1 baseline, share ongoing skin improvements, discuss seasonal routine adjustments, demonstrate authentic long-term product commitment. Feature customer transformations regularly—with enthusiastic permission, share before-after progress photos with timeline details, testimonial quotes about specific improvements, routine breakdowns showing which products they used, reinforcing Riman's effectiveness across different skin types and concerns. Share educational content consistently—ingredient spotlights explaining what actives do and why concentrations matter, routine building tips for different concerns, K-beauty philosophy principles, application technique videos showing proper product usage, seasonal skincare adjustments. Create Korean beauty culture content—if you engage with K-beauty trends, K-dramas, Korean culture, share this authentic interest, positioning Riman as genuine Korean skincare versus Western brands trying to capitalize on K-beauty trends. Build online beauty community—Facebook group, Instagram following, email list, or TikTok presence where you provide consistent value through skincare education, transformation sharing, and authentic beauty conversation, soft-introducing business opportunity periodically without pressure. Offer ongoing consultation support—position yourself as accessible skincare resource for customers and prospects, answering questions, troubleshooting concerns, celebrating improvements, building relationships that generate referrals. Continue learning about skincare science, Korean beauty innovations, ingredient research, esthetic trends, maintaining legitimate beauty authority rather than just memorizing sales scripts. Stay patient with business building—premium Korean skincare creates loyal customers with visible results who naturally refer friends and generate sustainable residual income, but this takes 6-12 months of consistent effort, transformation documentation, and authentic beauty passion rather than hyped income promises that attract wrong prospects and create quick churn.</li>

        <p><strong>Compliance note:</strong> Stay within Riman's policies and your local regulations. Avoid making unsubstantiated anti-aging or medical claims—focus on cosmetic benefits and ingredient properties. Be transparent about realistic results timelines and product pricing. Only share before-and-after photos with proper permissions and disclaimers. When discussing income opportunity, use official income disclosure statements. Ensure all ingredient claims can be verified with official Riman documentation.</p>
        <p>When in doubt, let the system do the heavy lifting—consistent skin assessments, ingredient education, and consultative positioning work better than hype or unrealistic beauty promises.</p>
