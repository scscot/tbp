Phase 2: Core Development (Weeks 5-8)

2.1 Flutter Integration Architecture
```dart
// Core chatbot screen implementation
class ChatBotScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  const ChatBotScreen({super.key});

  @override
  State<ChatBotScreen> createState() => _ChatBotScreenState();
}

class _ChatBotScreenState extends State<ChatBotScreen> {
  final ChatService _chatService = ChatService();
  final List<ChatMessage> _messages = [];
  final TextEditingController _messageController = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('AI Assistant'),
        backgroundColor: AppColors.primary,
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          _buildChatHeader(),
          Expanded(child: _buildMessagesList()),
          _buildInputArea(),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

2.2 Context-Aware Responses
```dart
// Integration with user progress data
class ChatService {
  Future<String> generateResponse(String userMessage) async {
    final userContext = await _getUserContext();
    final contextualPrompt = _buildContextualPrompt(userMessage, userContext);
    
    return await _aiService.generateResponse(contextualPrompt);
  }

  Map<String, dynamic> _getUserContext() {
    final user = Provider.of<UserModel>(context, listen: false);
    return {
      'directSponsors': user.directSponsorCount,
      'totalTeam': user.totalTeamCount,
      'isQualified': user.qualifiedDate != null,
      'accountAge': _calculateAccountAge(user.createdDate),
      'subscriptionStatus': user.subscriptionStatus,
    };
  }
}
```

2.3 Dashboard Integration
```dart
// Add chatbot card to existing dashboard
_buildActionCard(
  icon: Icons.smart_toy,
  title: 'AI Assistant',
  color: AppColors.teamAccent,
  onTap: () {
    Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => const ChatBotScreen(),
      ),
    );
  },
),
```

Phase 3: Core Capabilities (Weeks 9-12)

3.1 Interactive FAQ Assistant
```
Example Interactions:

User: "How does qualification work?"
Bot: "Great question! You need 4 direct sponsors + 20 total team members. 
     You currently have 2 direct and 8 total. 
     You're halfway to direct sponsors! Would you like specific strategies 
     for finding 2 more direct sponsors?"

User: "What's the difference between this and an MLM?"
Bot: "Team Build Pro is NOT an MLM or business opportunity. We're a software 
     tool - you pay us $4.99/month, we don't pay you anything. Think of us 
     like LinkedIn for direct sales professionals. Would you like me to 
     explain how this helps with legitimate business opportunities?"
```

3.2 Feature Discovery & Guidance
```
Context-Aware Suggestions:

For new users (< 1 week):
"I notice you're new to Team Build Pro! Have you explored the team 
analytics dashboard yet? With your growing team, it's a great way to 
track progress toward qualification."

For struggling users (low activity):
"It's been a few days since you've invited anyone new. That's totally 
normal - team building takes consistent effort. Would you like some 
proven strategies for finding people to invite?"

For qualified users:
"Congratulations on qualifying! Now that you've hit 4 direct + 20 total, 
you should have received your business opportunity invitation. Need help 
with next steps?"
```

3.3 Motivational Coaching
```
Progress-Based Encouragement:

"You're at 3 out of 4 direct sponsors - you're so close! Remember, 
this industry has a 99% failure rate, but you're in the top 1% who 
are actively building. One more direct sponsor and you'll be qualified!"

"Your team grew by 5 members this week - that's excellent progress! 
The key is consistent daily activity, and you're demonstrating that perfectly."
```
