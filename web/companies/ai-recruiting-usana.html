        <h2>What USANA Sells (in plain English)</h2>
        <p>USANA Health Sciences is a science-backed nutritional supplement company founded in 1992 by microbiologist Dr. Myron Wentz and headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. The flagship product line is CellSentials, a comprehensive vitamin and mineral system combining Core Minerals and Vita-Antioxidant for cellular nutrition. Key products include BiOmega (ultra-pure fish oil with vitamin D), Proflavanol C200 (grape seed extract and vitamin C), MagneCal D (calcium-magnesium-vitamin D), Probiotic (digestive health), and the Celavive skincare line featuring botanical extracts and peptides. Additional categories include weight management (Nutrimeal shakes, Diet Plus bars), sports nutrition (Procosa joint health, Pure Rest sleep support), and energy products (Rev3 Surge energy drink).</p>
        <p class="muted">USANA manufactures products in-house at a Salt Lake City GMP-certified facility, ensuring pharmaceutical-grade quality control that exceeds typical supplement industry standards—a key competitive differentiator.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Who Buys USANA</h3>
          <p>USANA attracts health-conscious professionals seeking premium supplementation, athletes requiring third-party tested products free from banned substances, individuals with chronic health concerns wanting pharmaceutical-grade quality, and wellness-focused families prioritizing preventative nutrition. The customer base skews 35-60 years old with above-average income and education levels. The business opportunity appeals to healthcare professionals (nurses, chiropractors, nutritionists), fitness coaches, former corporate professionals seeking entrepreneurship, and experienced network marketers valuing scientifically-backed products over hype-driven offerings.</p>
          <p class="muted">Strong presence in North America, Asia-Pacific (especially China and Philippines), Europe, and Latin America with multilingual support.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>How USANA Distributes</h3>
          <p>USANA operates a multi-level marketing compensation plan with commissions, bonuses, and incentives based on sales volume and team development. Distributors must maintain 100 Personal Volume (PV) monthly to qualify for commissions—approximately $132.95 in product purchases or nearly $1,600 annually. The plan rewards both retail sales and team building through unilevel commissions and matching bonuses. Ranks progress from Distributor through Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Ruby, Emerald, Diamond, and beyond. The publicly-traded company (NASDAQ: USNA) provides financial transparency uncommon in network marketing.</p>
          <p class="muted">Key insight: Monthly autoship requirement means retention is critical—focus on genuine product believers, not opportunity seekers chasing commissions.</p>

        <h2>Training & Onboarding Snapshot</h2>
        <p>USANA emphasizes scientific credibility, third-party testing, and cellular health education in training. New distributors learn about Dr. Wentz's background, pharmaceutical manufacturing standards, and nutritional science through online training portals, corporate webinars, and annual conventions. The company provides product certifications, health assessments, and marketing compliance training. However, traditional training focuses on explaining science and product benefits—leaving systematic digital prospecting, automated customer nurture sequences, and scalable team duplication largely unaddressed. Most distributors struggle converting scientific credibility into consistent sales without advanced marketing skills.</p>

        <h2>Your AI Recruiting Playbook for USANA</h2>
        <ol class="checklist">
          <li><strong>Quality-first positioning.</strong> Create comparison content showing USANA's pharmaceutical GMP manufacturing vs. typical supplement brands. Use AI to target audiences already buying premium vitamins from Whole Foods or Thorne—they understand quality pricing and are your ideal customers.</li>
          <li><strong>Athlete and sports nutrition targeting.</strong> USANA is NSF Certified for Sport and trusted by professional athletes. Build content showcasing third-party testing for banned substances. Use AI to distribute to CrossFit communities, endurance athletes, and college sports programs where supplement safety is paramount.</li>
          <li><strong>Health assessment automation.</strong> USANA provides health questionnaires to identify nutritional gaps. Digitize this into an AI-powered chatbot that provides personalized supplement recommendations. Gate the results behind email opt-in, building your nurture list automatically.</li>
          <li><strong>Autoship retention sequences.</strong> The 100 PV monthly requirement means retention determines long-term income. Build AI-triggered check-ins at day 15 (mid-cycle usage reminder), day 25 (reorder prompt), and day 35 (cancellation prevention for missed orders). Most distributors ignore retention until it's too late.</li>
          <li><strong>Professional credential leveraging.</strong> If you're a nurse, chiropractor, or nutritionist, create authority content positioning USANA as your professional recommendation. Use AI to distribute to patients, clients, and professional networks. Healthcare professional endorsements carry exponentially more weight than general testimonials.</li>
          <li><strong>Celavive skincare cross-sell.</strong> Customers buying CellSentials are prime candidates for Celavive skincare. Build automated 60-day sequences introducing topical cellular health after supplement habits are established. "You're feeding cells internally—here's the external complement" creates natural expansion.</li>
          <li><strong>Scientific content repurposing.</strong> USANA publishes clinical research and white papers. Use AI to transform dense scientific documents into social-friendly infographics, short videos, and email sequences. Make the science accessible without dumbing it down—that's your competitive moat against hype-driven competitors.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Compliance note:</strong> USANA policies prohibit disease treatment claims, medical advice, and unapproved income representations. Focus on nutritional science, manufacturing quality, third-party certifications, and general wellness support. Use official product pages and approved marketing materials. When discussing business opportunity, always include income disclosure statement and clarify that success requires consistent monthly product purchases and team development. Never claim products diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent disease.</p>
        <p>When in doubt, let the system do the heavy lifting—consistent health assessments, automated retention check-ins, and scientific content distribution work better than exaggerated health claims or income promises.</p>
