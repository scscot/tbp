        <h2>What Neumi Sells (in plain English)</h2>
        <p>Neumi is a fast-growing wellness company founded by Steven K. Scott, approaching its 5th anniversary and already recognized as one of the fastest-growing network marketing companies globally. The core innovation is HydraStat Technology—a proprietary delivery system that breaks down large molecules and envelops them in ultra-pure water clusters for dramatically enhanced bioavailability. The flagship product is NutriSwish, a potent liquid supplement blending glutathione (the body's master antioxidant), L-cysteine (glutathione precursor), curcumin (anti-inflammatory turmeric extract), and vitamin C for maximum absorption. Neumi Skin applies the same glutathione technology topically for skincare benefits. The product portfolio focuses on cellular health, antioxidant support, and anti-aging from both internal and external approaches.</p>
        <p class="muted">Neumi's HydraStat Technology addresses the bioavailability challenge that plagues most supplements—ingredients that aren't absorbed provide zero benefit, making delivery mechanism the competitive differentiator.</p>
      </section>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Who Buys Neumi</h3>
          <p>Neumi attracts biohackers and wellness enthusiasts seeking advanced supplement technology, individuals researching glutathione for cellular health and detoxification, anti-aging consumers wanting both topical and internal approaches, health-conscious professionals seeking clean ingredient formulations, and people frustrated with traditional supplements that don't deliver results. The customer base skews 35-60 years old with above-average health literacy and willingness to invest in premium wellness solutions. The business opportunity appeals to wellness entrepreneurs, supplement industry veterans seeking cutting-edge products, network marketing professionals attracted to fast-growing companies, and health coaches monetizing their expertise.</p>
          <p class="muted">Rapidly expanding global presence with strong growth momentum in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific markets.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>How Neumi Distributes</h3>
          <p>Neumi operates a seven-level unilevel compensation plan paying affiliates on recruitment and retail sales with residual commissions through team depth. Qualification requires 100 PV (Personal Volume) monthly to earn commissions. Welcome Packs range from $100 (1 bottle NutriSwish + 1 bottle Neumi Skin) to $1,000 for larger starter packages. Basic affiliate membership costs $100 to $1,000 depending on entry level. The simplified structure makes onboarding straightforward while the young company status offers ground-floor positioning unusual in established network marketing. Fast growth trajectory creates momentum and excitement around business-building potential.</p>
          <p class="muted">Key insight: Young company means less market saturation—your warm market hasn't been approached by 5 other distributors yet, giving you first-mover advantage in your network.</p>

        <h2>Training & Onboarding Snapshot</h2>
        <p>Neumi emphasizes HydraStat Technology education, glutathione science, and bioavailability advantages in training. New affiliates learn about cellular health, antioxidant benefits, and product application through online training portals, team webinars, and upline mentorship. The company provides scientific explanations of molecular delivery mechanisms and comparison content versus traditional supplements. However, being a younger company, systematic digital marketing training, automated prospecting systems, and advanced duplication infrastructure are still developing. Most affiliates rely on personal enthusiasm and individual creativity for lead generation and team building without standardized playbooks.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Your AI Recruiting Playbook for Neumi</h2>
        <ol class="checklist">
          <li><strong>Bioavailability-first messaging.</strong> Most people waste money on supplements their bodies can't absorb. Create content specifically addressing bioavailability problems with traditional pills and capsules. Position HydraStat as the solution. Use AI to target audiences already buying expensive supplements—they understand quality pricing and are frustrated with poor results.</li>
          <li><strong>Glutathione education sequences.</strong> Most prospects don't know what glutathione is or why it matters. Build a 5-day automated email course explaining the master antioxidant, cellular health, and detoxification. Gate it behind email opt-in. Educate first, sell second—this builds authority and filters serious buyers from tire-kickers.</li>
          <li><strong>Biohacker community targeting.</strong> Neumi's science-forward approach resonates with biohacking audiences. Create content for Reddit's r/Biohacking, longevity forums, and anti-aging communities. Use AI to systematically engage these groups with educational content positioning HydraStat as next-generation delivery technology.</li>
          <li><strong>Before-and-after energy tracking.</strong> Glutathione benefits often manifest as energy, mental clarity, and recovery improvements. Build AI-prompted daily check-ins for new customers tracking subjective wellness markers. Collect testimonials at 30, 60, and 90 days showing progressive improvement. Quantified self-data converts skeptics.</li>
          <li><strong>Ground-floor opportunity positioning.</strong> Neumi's young age is an advantage for recruiting business builders. Create content comparing the company's 5-year trajectory to established MLMs at their 5-year mark. Use AI to distribute to experienced network marketers looking for the next growth wave before market saturation.</li>
          <li><strong>Swish ritual habit formation.</strong> NutriSwish works best when used consistently. Build automated habit-formation sequences: morning routine integration tips, reminder notifications, usage tracking, and milestone celebrations at 7, 30, 60 days. Retention drives residual income—habits drive retention.</li>
          <li><strong>Topical + internal cross-sell.</strong> Customers buying NutriSwish are natural candidates for Neumi Skin and vice versa. Build automated 60-day cross-sell sequences introducing the complementary product. "You're supporting cellular health internally—here's the external approach" creates natural expansion without pushy upselling.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

        <h2>AI Message Starters (copy/paste)</h2>
        <div class="grid-2">
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Supplement buyer (bioavailability angle)</h3>
            <p>"Quick question—do you know if your supplements are actually absorbing? Most capsules have 10-30% bioavailability. Our HydraStat Technology solves that. I can send a 2-minute science video if you're curious."</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Biohacker/longevity focused</h3>
            <p>"Are you familiar with glutathione as the master antioxidant? Most oral forms don't absorb well. Our NutriSwish uses nano-technology for cellular delivery. Want the research summary?"</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Anti-aging wellness buyer</h3>
            <p>"We approach aging from inside (glutathione for cellular health) and outside (topical glutathione skin serum). Both use the same HydraStat absorption technology. I have a product overview if that interests you."</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Business builder (ground-floor opportunity)</h3>
            <p>"Neumi is approaching year 5 and already one of the fastest-growing network marketing companies globally. That's rare momentum. If I share the comp plan and growth trajectory, would you look at it?"</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <section class="muted">
        <p><strong>Compliance note:</strong> Neumi policies prohibit medical claims, disease treatment promises, and unapproved health benefit statements. Focus on bioavailability science, cellular health support, and general wellness experiences. Use official product pages and approved marketing materials. When discussing business opportunity, clarify that success requires consistent customer acquisition, monthly volume maintenance, and team development effort. Never claim products diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent disease.</p>
        <p>When in doubt, let the system do the heavy lifting—consistent glutathione education, automated wellness tracking, and habit formation sequences work better than exaggerated health claims or get-rich-quick income promises.</p>
