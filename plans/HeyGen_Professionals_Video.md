## Full Script

```
What do the 25% who don't quit have in common? They start Day 1 with momentum — a team already building.

If you're in direct sales, you know the pattern. You sign someone, they're excited for a week, then it fades. Group chats go quiet. You're starting from scratch again.

Team Build Pro changes that. It's an AI recruiting app that works with YOUR company and YOUR link.

Here's what's different: prospects download the app through your link and start pre-building their team BEFORE they commit. They use 16 proven messages to reach out. The AI Coach guides them 24/7.

And you see your entire downline growing in real-time.

The result? New recruits arrive Day 1 with momentum instead of from zero. Same system. True duplication.
